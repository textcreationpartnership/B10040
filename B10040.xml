         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas I intended to have preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe plaine and ſimple Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to the patronage of ſome of my friends, who were pleaſed to owne and favour mee in my ſufferings; without any apology for my ſelfe, or any vindication of the truths which I have delivered. I am now by weighty reaſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to alter my reſolutions: And my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts doe appear better unto me then my firſt. (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)</p>
            <p>I have beene lately aſperſed by the hands of two and fifty who profeſſe themſelves the Miniſters of Chriſt; as a man heterodox and unſound in my principles, concerning the the Law and Juſtification by free grace. Wherefore it ſeemeth probable unto me, that if I ſhould bring my friends upon the Stage to
<pb facs="tcp:180666:3"/>patronize mee in a publique way, while I lye under the reproachings of ſo many, I ſhould wrong thoſe, whom I deſire in thankfulneſſe to reſpect and honour. And if I ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe Sermons into the world without any Apology for my ſelfe, I might prove more injurious to my ſelfe, then theſe can be unto mee. Beſides this, I doe apprehend that ſome tender-hearted Chriſtians when they ſhall read the name of the abuſed Author, now made infamous unto them by the hands of ſo many Subſcribers, may either be affraid to read what I have printed; or if they ſhall read it, an uncharitable prejudice may rob them of the fruit and harveſt of their reading.</p>
            <p>For theſe and other reaſons, I have uſhered in theſe Sermons into the world with a ſhort Apologeticall anſwer to their Charge. And have made choiſe of thee as an Umpire and Judge between my accuſers and my ſelfe. And truely thou art the fitteſt man that I could ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle out from the men of the world, to do me this ſervice of love; whether I looke upon my ſelfe, or my Antagoniſts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If I looke upon my <hi>Antagoniſts,</hi> thou art not within their gun-ſhot, or cenſure, and ſo thou canſt not not be damnified by me, 1 Cor. 2.15. <hi>The ſpirituall man judgeth all things, yet he himſelfe is judged by no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:180666:3"/>
            <p>Secondly, If I looke unto my ſelfe, thou art the fitteſt, and only man for mee. For thou wilt not deale rigorouſly with me. <hi>Thou wilt juge mee by the law of love, liberty and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,</hi> Jam. 2.12. And when I ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what weakeneſſes, frailties and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have diſcovered themſelves in my fleſh, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in thoſe things (whether in praying, preaching, or writing) wherein I deſire to be moſt ſpirituall; I dare not thinke of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judge. Thou wilt be more favourable then the Synod at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> unto my way and manner of preaching and expreſſions, which I made uſe of five or ſixe yeares ſince; conſidering that I then had not beene many moneths in the Schoole of Chriſt. Thou wilt be more indulgent unto this booke which now ſheweth it ſelfe to the world, then the whole Aſſembly of <hi>Sion-Colledge</hi> Divines, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that at this time I have been but the time of an Apprentiſhip in the Schoole of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. I neede not make an Apology for my ſelfe before thee, to tell thee, that theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were never intended for the Preſſe by the deliverer of them: but brought thither by the skilfull hand of one profeſſing the Art of ſhort-writing. Thou wilt willingly of thy ſelfe pardon the method and immethodical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour, then defirous to implore it, doe looke upon my ſelfe as the
<pb facs="tcp:180666:4"/>vileſt of thoſe who ever made any addreſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee; when I conſider my ſinſulneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was convinced of ſinne, my unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous righteouſneſſe before I came into the light, and my praevarications and averſions from God, ſince I received his light. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> compoſed a ſmall booke, which hee called his <hi>Confeſſions:</hi> in which he doth ſpread forth his follies unto the world before his Converſion: But ſhould I ſet downe all the follies, vanities and wickedneſſe of my youth, a great volume would not hold them: And it is eaſier to write large volumes of them, then to bring them within the narrow limits and borders of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</p>
            <p>That I may therefore paſſe theſe by, as God hath paſſed them by in his grace, never to call them to his remembrance againſt meany more: I doe now acknowledge, that by the reaſon of variety of inward temptations; ſince I have looked towards Religion, I have beene in my owne apprehenſion a meere <hi>Proteus</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. I have beene zealous for the workes of the Law, that I might be made a righteous man, being ignorant of him who is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe for every one that believeth: and was then as loathſome a ſinner to the eye of God, as I was a righteous man
<pb facs="tcp:180666:5"/>to the eyes of the world. I have ſuddenly lept from Phariſaiſme to the profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in a carnal way: and have then been ready to thinke that I could never be a true Goſpel-profeſſour, unleſſe I did take ſome liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the allowance which I now apprehend the Goſpel affordeth. I have beene ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly inquiſitive after the knowledge of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, that I have doubted whether ever I ſhould be ſaved, dying ignorant of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonces, and Church-government of the Lord Jeſus. And looking for light, and finding darkneſſe and confuſion in theſe things, I have beene afterwards as ſpiritually mad and fooliſh in the undervaluing of them. There is ſcarce an errour to be thought of, but by the folly and curioſity of my nature, I have beene tempted to reach forth my hand unto it. I have rune over the bogges of Familiſme, but have not beene ſwallowed up in them; Yet that I may not be miſtaken in this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notwithſtanding all this; <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though the world hath looked upon mee as an Heretique, I have ſeene my ſelfe ſo faſt in the armes of God, that I am confident, that neither men, Devills, Errours, ſinnes, nor temptations, ſhall ever be able to pull
<pb facs="tcp:180666:5"/>mee thence. I have beene dead by the law to the law, and am alive by the Goſpell. I have ceaſed from works, and yet am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to good workes. <hi>I am not under the Law, and yet in my minde I ſerve the Law of GOD. I can doe nothing, and yet can doe all things in CHRIST which ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me.</hi> And though I can doe all things, I am an unprofitable ſervant; I care not much what men can ſay of mee, ſeeing GOD doth daily aſſure mee in the Spirit of Chriſt, that I am his Sonne. It doth not too much afflict mee if any men refuſe to have fellowſhip with mee as a <hi>SAINT,</hi> ſeeing I have fellowſhip with the Father, and his Sonne <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> and thy ſelfe, and have liberty in my Conſcience to have fellowſhip with all <hi>SAINTS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My greateſt ſorrow, and moſt delightfull griefe at this preſent is this, That I am not more holy, being ſo ſtrongly aſſured by truth that I am happy. I hope that thou wilt further this worke of purity in mee by thy ſpirituall prayers preſented to the Throne of our <hi>FATHERS</hi> grace for mee; where I doe deſire that thou wouldſt know mee one with thy ſelfe, being one SPIRIT with <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> though
<pb facs="tcp:180666:6"/>I cannot but ſubſcribe my ſelfe, The greateſt of <hi>SINNERS,</hi> and leſſe then then the leaſt of all <hi>SAINTS,</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I reade your un-ſcripture-like termes, which you make uſe of, in preſenting your new modalled Government to the world, as the government of Jeſus Chriſt; I wonder with what faces in theſe times of light, ye ſhould dare to hold it forth as the unqueſtionable government of CHRIST by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right, and ſhould ſo uncharitably cenſure all men as <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> or ſuperſtitious perſons,
<pb facs="tcp:180666:7"/>who doe expreſſe their diſlike of it, or refuſe to be conformable unto the ſame.</p>
            <p>Not to runne farre for an inſtance of one of theſe termes; It ſeemeth that the ſtrange and hidden vertue of your <hi>Presbyterian-government</hi> hath ſuddenly turned our famous Citie into a Province, and made you Miniſters of this <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Province. Did ever CHRIST or his Apoſtles turne free Cites or Countreyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Provinces by bringing in any Eccleſiaſticall government upon thoſe who were converted to the faith? What is any Province to ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but a Region or Countrey ſubdued by force of Armes, and kept under juriſdiction by a Lieutenant ſent thither with Commiſſion to governe; as the Schoole-boyes know very well, who know the meaning of that phraſe in <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare</hi> Commentaries <hi>(in provinciam redigere.)</hi> To turne ſuch a free Countrey into a Province to the <hi>Romans.</hi> I know that it is the deſigne of ſome to turne our Shires and Countreyes into Provinces; and to wreſt power from the Civill Magiſtrate, by which they may ſet up their Lieutenants to enſlave the Magiſtrates and all the people of the Kingdome to their <hi>Preabyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Command and Dominion. But I cannot yet remember when <hi>London</hi> was turned into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, unleſſe ſome of you did ſecretly and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly

            <p>But I touch now upon an unpleaſing ſtring, I ſhall therefore leave it with a ſad Apoſiope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis: and ſhall entreate you ſeriouſly to conſider ſome things which I ſhall acquaint you with, in relation to my ſelfe, and your dealing with mee, willingly acquitting thoſe among you, and as farre as I may; who having ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to thoſe Articles againſt mee, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read or heard of my name in the Booke.

            <p>In the firſt place I doe ſuppoſe that ſome of you upon mature deliberation, may apprehend that you have beene too raſh in cenſuring mee upon Maſter <hi>Gatakers</hi> teſtimonie, if it ſhall appeare unto you that I was freed by Maſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> (whom I name in thankefulneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for his love unto mee, and to let men know that I have found more of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, ſincerity, and love in him then in any who have beene favourers of the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian government.</hi>) To ſhew my willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and readineſſe to free my ſelfe from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions which men had entertained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe things which I held.

And this was done many months before Maſter <hi>Gataker</hi> did fling his fire-brands at me, to charge me with thoſe things in which in his judgement I had cleared my ſelfe. And leſt any ſhould make nothing of this; uncharitably ſuppoſing that I might hold one thing in my heart, and write another thing to him. I am willing if he pleaſe, that he ſhall Print what I delivered unto him, and make it publique. If this be conſidered by men of tender conſciences, (if that character of a good man be not odious unto you) ſome of you who knew of this, may read your maliciouſneſſe, and all of you your raſhneſſe, who have condemned me by your Cenſures. When <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> deſired <hi>Liberius</hi> to ſubſcribe to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and Excommunication of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> he made him this anſwer. <hi>O Emperour, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall cenſures are not to be paſſed without a great deale of juſtice.</hi> (O Imperator inquit ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicia Eccleſiaſtica decet cum maximâ proferri juſtitiâ. <hi>Trip.

            <p>Let me ſpeake plainly unto you, not to ſhame you, but to convince you of your fault; When I am moſt
<pb facs="tcp:180666:9"/>ſerious and free from all turbulency of paſſion, I have apprehended that I ſhould have found more juſtice in the High-Commiſſion Court, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my Brethren. The <hi>Civilians</hi> ſay that wee muſt not paſſe our judgement upon a law by one line of it. <hi>(De lege non judicandum ex ſolâ lineâ.)</hi> And Chriſtian juſtice and equity, will teach us, not to cenſure Goſpel-Sermons by one line malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly or ignorantly taken out of it; knowing that a ſpirituall man now, as well as <hi>Paul</hi> formerly, may have ſome things hard to be underſtood <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Secondly, Give me leave to enquire of you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirituall prudence would teach you to be ſo violent againſt godly men who differ in ſome noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, expreſſions, and circumſtantialls from you; When there are ſo many Sepulchers wide open againſt you and them, ready to devoure you both. It was the policy of ſome barbarous people, when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> came to contend with them for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, as <hi>Curtius</hi> doth relate it, to put an end of the wars and differences which were among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that ſo they might be ſtrengthned againſt the common enemy. And the like policy was uſed by the ancient Inhabitants of the Land, when <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> came to invade them; &amp; whether Chriſtian wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:180666:9"/>will make us leſſe prudent and politicke for our own preſervation; I ſhall be willing that it may be determined by the man, who liveth in the cleare light and liberty of the Goſpel.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt Errour which is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon me is this. That the morall law is of no uſe at all to a believer; no rule for him to walk by. And that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are free from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory power of it. Delivered by Mr. <hi>Simpſon,</hi> witneſſe Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi>—</p>
               <p>This Article doth conſiſt of four branches. The firſt, That the law is of no uſe at all to a believer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When ſome either through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, miſ-apprehending, or through malice miſ-reporting what I had delivered in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Doctrine of the Law and Goſpel, had ſpread this abroad; to wit, that I denyed the uſe of the Law. To ſtop the mouth of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fame, I preached at <hi>Algate</hi> (where I was then an unworthy Steward of the myſteries of God) upon theſe words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Wee know that the Law is good if a man uſe it lawfully:</hi> and did wholly diſavow this tenet, proving the uſefulneſſe of the Law,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180666:11"/>and ſhewing what uſe Believers, and the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpel might make of it. A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is a creature ſpiritua ly intelligent, and rationall, and by the helps and light of grace can make a good uſe of every thing, and ſo conſequently a good uſe of the Law. So that to my beſt remembrance I was never ſo much as tempted, to think that the Law is of no uſe unto him. And what I then delivered concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the law, &amp; the uſefulneſſe of it, might have prevented this charge; If my Father had not ſeen it good for me for a time to lye under a cloud of ſlanders &amp; reproaches, that ſo I might be made conformable unto my head. It is uſual with ignorant and malicious hearers of the Goſpel, to draw wilde and looſe concluſions, from good premiſes and ſound truths, which they heare from the mouths of their teachers, and then to faſten them upon them, as though they were their own tenents. Thus ſome did ſlanderouſly report concerning <hi>Paul,</hi> that he affirmed <hi>that men ſhould doe evill, that good might come,</hi> Rom. 3.8. And thus the Papiſts have charged the Proteſtants (and firſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God did make uſe of, to bring us from Popiſh and Antichriſtian darkeneſſe) as men who opened a gap to all looſeneſſe and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe of life and converſation, becauſe they aſſerted that Chriſtians might be, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180666:11"/>ought to be aſſured of their ſalvation; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the falling away from grace: and thus ſome have been too bold with me in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. And when I have proved the law to be uſeleſſe unto us in many particulars, they have concluded that I did totally deny the uſe of the Law, which hath been the ground of this groundleſſe aſperſion: unto which I think it needleſſe to give any larger anſwer.</p>
               <p>Concerning the 3. other branches in this Article, to wit, that it is no rule for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to walk by, nor to examine his life by: and that Chriſtians are freee from the mandatory power of it: I can either affirm, or deny them all. I doe acknowledge that in a ſence we may be ſaid to be under the rule and power of the Law, and in a ſence it is true, that we are not under the rule and power of it; which if it be well weighed by the ballance of right reaſon, whether theſe who have charged me with this, not ſtateing the queſtion as I did when I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my judgment, and ſuppreſſing my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their Article, may be juſtified in this action, I leave it to any man truly rationall, and unprejudiced concerning me, yea to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when God ſhall awaken their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, to judge. Wherefore that the truth of God, and my meaning may be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I ſhall preſent to the view of the Reader
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180666:12"/>the diſtinctions which I made uſe of in the handling of this controverſie.</p>
               <p>The firſt diſtinction is this, that the Law may be conſidered as delivered in <hi>Sinai</hi> &amp; <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Gal.</hi> 4.24. As the covenant of <hi>Sinai,</hi> or as a part of the covenant of <hi>Sion,</hi> Iſa 2.3. <hi>For out of Zion ſhall goe forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. As 1. delivered by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 2. by the hand of Chriſt. And though this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction hath beene branded by ſome of the learned Teachers of our times in their Pulpits and Preſſes, with the infamous mark of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſme,</hi> yet I doe not doubt, but that I ſhall eaſily prove it to be a Scripture diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is the meaning of that ſpeech of <hi>John,</hi> Joh. 1.17. <hi>The law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but grace &amp; truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> By <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is, by the hand of <hi>Moſes?</hi> As it is plain by <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.46. <hi>Theſe are the laws w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Lord made between him and the Children of Iſrael in mount Sinai by the hand of</hi> Moſes. So <hi>grace and truth is given by the hand of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt is ſtiled <hi>the Mediator of the better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8.6. And as he is the Mediator of this better Covenant, he doth give the law to the Saints by his hand in this Covenant. This diſtinction is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed by <hi>Zanchius</hi> (4. <hi>Tom. operum delege.</hi>) <hi>(Tranſlata eſt lex a Moſe ad Chriſtum, e manu
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180666:12"/>Moſis in manum Chriſti veri mediatoris: ſicut et ſacerdotium ab Aarone ad Chriſtum verum aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numque Pontificem tranſlatum eſt. Tranſlato au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſacerdotio, neceſſe eſt (inquit Apoſtolus) ut et legis tranſlatio fiat.)</hi> The law (ſaith hee) is tranſlated from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt, out of the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> into the hand of Chriſt, the true Mediator, as the Prieſt-hood is tranſlated from <hi>Aaron</hi> to Chriſt, the true and eternall high Prieſt. For the Prieſt-hood being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it is needfull (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that there be a change of the Law.</hi> And in the ſame booke he hath afterward theſe words. <hi>(Dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus legem, quatenus fuit in manu Moſis, abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatam jam eſſe per Chriſtum fidelibus: ſed quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus jam eſt in manu Chriſti confirmatam eſſe, &amp; conſtabilitam.)</hi> We ſay that the Law as it was in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is now abrogated to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers by Chriſt: but as it is in the hand of Chriſt, it is confirmed and eſtabliſhed. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren give mee an anſwer in the ſpirit of love and meekeneſſe to this queſtion: why ſhould you cenſure me to be an <hi>Antinomian</hi> for make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of this diſtinction, ſeeing ye account <hi>Zanchius</hi> to be a ſound and orthodox writer, who maintaineth the ſame thing?</p>
               <p>Having premiſed theſe diſtinctions, I ſhall anſwer plainly to theſe ſeverall branches, and not be affraid to owne what I have delivered,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180666:13"/>becauſe I am ſtill confident, that it is the truth of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The law as delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> is not the rule by which a believing Chriſtian doth walk, but as it is delivered unto him in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace by the hand of the Lord Jeſus. I ſhall prove this by this argument. A cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works is not the rule by which a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſtian doth walk.</p>
               <p>The law as delivered in <hi>Sinai</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is a Covenant of works.</p>
               <p>Therefore the law as delivered in <hi>Sinai</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> is not a rule by which a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Chriſtian doth walk.</p>
               <p>I doe ſuppoſe that you will not deny the major propoſition; You will not ſay, that a covenant of workes is the rule of a Chriſtian: for then a Chriſtian ſhould worke, that hee might live, whereas a true Chriſtian doth work becauſe he doth live, and hath life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works.</p>
               <p>If ye ſhall deny the minor or ſecond propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, I ſhall prove it by theſe reaſons which are drawn from Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The Apoſtle doth frequently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the righteouſneſſe of the law, and the law to the righteouſneſſe of grace, &amp; the covenant of grace, which hee could not doe if the law were a covenant of grace. 1. Hee oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180666:13"/>the righteouſneſſe of the Law and Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5.6. <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth the righteouſneſs which is of the Law, <hi>that the man which doth thoſe things ſhall live by them.</hi> But the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe <hi>is the righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> verſ. 6. Obſerve the Apoſtles words well, he doth not ſay that the Law requireth doing and working for juſtification, according to the falſe gloſſes, and interpretations of the Phariſees, as ſome Writers of late with the Papiſts of old have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. But <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe of the law ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> He oppoſeth the law and the Covenant of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over you, becauſe ye are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> What ſence can you make of theſe words, if ye ſhall aſſert the law to be a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace: for then this will be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words. <hi>Sinne ſhall not have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over you, becauſe ye are not under the law</hi> or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, <hi>but under grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The Apoſtle doth affirme, <hi>that no fleſh ſhall be juſtified by the law, becauſe by the law is the knowledge of ſinne,</hi> Rom. 3.20. But if the law were a covenant of grace, a man might be juſtified by it. And therefore I conclude that it is not a covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. The Apoſtle affirmeth, <hi>that if righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſE come by the law, then Chriſt is dead in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:180666:14"/>vaine.</hi> And ſhall wee ſay that that is the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace by which righteouſneſſe cannot come unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. The Apoſtle plainly ſaith, <hi>that the law is not of faith: but the man that doth them ſhall live in them,</hi> Gal. 3.12. Fom whence I frame my argument thus;</p>
               <p>That covenant which requireth works, and not faith for juſtification, is not a covenant of grace: but the law requireth workes, and not faith for juſtification.</p>
               <p>And therefore the law is not a covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>But that I may not be miſtaken in what I have here ſpoken, I ſhall lay downe ſuch cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were laid downe, when I handled the point more largely.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Though I deny the law to be a rule as it was delivered in the letter upon Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> yet I doe not deny the matter &amp; ſubſtance of it in the ſpirit, as it is delivered unto us by the mighty Counſellor, and great Law-giver, our Lord Jeſus, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.22. I doe ſubſcribe unto that as a truth, which is delivered by <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius:</hi> That this difference of divine lawes is not ſo much from the various ſubſtance of the lawes, or diverſity of times, as from the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reaſons, with which they were promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, and exhibited to the Church.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:180666:14"/>
                  <hi>(Differentia haec legum divinarum, non tam a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riâ legum ſubſtantiâ, temporumve diverſitate, quam a variis rationibus quibus illae fuerunt a Deo promulgatae, atque exhibitae eccleſiae.)</hi> I doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with <hi>Paul, that in the minde I my ſelfe doe ſerve the law of God,</hi> not only by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the grace of God through Chriſt for juſtification: but by loving God and my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a ſanctifying work of the ſpirit of grace in mee. I confeſſe that the law is olde for the matter &amp; ſubſtance of it, as it commandeth love to God and our neighbour; and yet it is new in us and to us, as it is delivered in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Goſpel. According to that of <hi>John. A new Commandement,</hi> to wit, of love, <hi>I write unto you, which is true in him and in you,</hi> 1 John 2.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> I doe not deny, but that this law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or preached, may be called the externall rule of the Spirit, as the law of the Spirit in us is the internall and powerfull rule. And that I may not now be cenſured, as I have formerly been by ſome, when I have ſpoken unto them, concerning the law of the Spirit, I ſhal ſpeak in the words of another, whom you acknowledg to be ſound in the faith, &amp; not in my own. The law of the Spirit in the ſubſtance of it, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the will of God, but imprinted in vivified hearts by the Spirit of God, by which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:180666:15"/>wee doe not only truly know God, and piety and equity: but we are ſo moved to feare him, to truſt in him, to love him, to worſhip and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him: and to love and ſerve our neighbour, and to mortifie our ſelves, and to beare valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all perſecutions for God, and to lead a life in Chriſt, that we willingly run to the doing of theſe things. (<hi>Ad ſubſtantiam autem quod atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net lex iſta ſpiritus, nihil aliud eſt, quam voluntas Dei, ſed cordibus per ſpiritum ſanctum vivifiatis impreſſa, quâ non ſolum novimus vere Deum, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatemque &amp; aequitatem, ſed etiam ad eum timen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, ei fidendum, eum amandum, colendum, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum: ad proximum item diligendum, eique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviendum: denique ad noſtri mortificationem ad mala omnia propter Deum fortiter perferenda, et ad vitam tantum in Chriſto traducendam, ita impelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur ut ultró accurramus,</hi> Zanc.)</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. I doe grant, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did acquaint the people with Jeſus Chriſt, after he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the law of workes unto them: which is evident by that paſſage in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. when the people being terrified at the giving of the Law, deſired <hi>that they might heare the voyce of the Lord no more;</hi> God doth affirme in the 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> that they had ſpoken well; and in the 18. <hi>verſe</hi> doth give them a promiſe of Chriſt. <hi>I will raiſe them up a Prophet from among their Brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth, and hee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:180666:15"/>ſhall ſpeak unto them all that I ſhall command him, &amp;c.</hi> which is ſufficient to wipe away the dirt and filth which is throwne upon mee by ſome ſcurrilous Pamphleters, with whoſe names I wil not burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the page, who have aſſerted that I denyed that there was any Goſpel or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace in the times of the old Teſtament: and that men were then ſaved by the covenant of works. Though I can in truth profeſſe, that by my beſt remembrance at the preſent, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remember that ever I was tempted to think any ſuch thing, ſince I received any ſpirituall light for the knowledge of the Goſpel. And thus much in anſwer to the ſecond branch of this Article.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to ſpeake much to the third, it being eaſie for any rationall man, to gather my meaning of it from what hath been delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in opening of my mind concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond branch. The law in the new Covenant is that, by which a Chriſtian doth examine his life: he liveth but under one Covenant for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification &amp; ſanctification, when he liveth as a ſpiritual man ought to live. <hi>He hath not received the ſpirit of bondage again to feare: but the ſpirit of adoption by which he cryeth Abba father,</hi> Rom. 8.15. But if hee ſhould examine his life by the law as delivered in <hi>Sinai,</hi> he would fear again, for that law worketh fear and horror in thoſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:180666:16"/>who are under it. Suppoſe a man ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his ſonne and his ſlave the ſame thing for ſubſtance; and withall ſhould informe his ſon that if hee ſhould not obey his command, hee ſhould diſpleaſe a loving father; but if the ſlave ſhould not obey his command, hee ſhould loſe his life by his diſobedience; would not any man affirm that theſe two did examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the ſame rule of their obedience? Thus it is in the point in hand: God commandeth love in the firſt Covenant, with threatnings of death and condemnation for diſobedience; and in the ſecond Covenant <hi>we are aſſured that wee are paſſed from death to life, and ſhall not come into condemnation; and that nothing ſhall ſeparate us from the love of our Father in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8. Yet this is made known unto us, that though by ſin we ſhall not totally fall from grace, and fall under condemnation: yet we may offend our Father, <hi>and grieve his holy Spirit, by which we are ſealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> Whether theſe two have the ſame rule given unto them for the examination of their lives, I will leave it to thoſe who have ſpirituall eyes in their heads to judge? To whom it will be evident, that Saints doe not fall from grace to the law when they examin themſelves: but they examin themſelves how they keep the Commandements of the new Covenant, which are ſummed up in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:180666:16"/>few words by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> to wit, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and to love one another as he gave us Commandement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall now fall upon the fourth branch of this Article: and ſhall deſire my Reader to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his eye thoſe diſtinctions and cautions, which I have already laid down, while we ſhall more largely prove, that a believer is not under the mandatory power of the law of the olde Covenant, but under the mandatory power of the law in the new Covenant of grace. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a believing Chriſtian ſhould live under the Covenant of grace, as it is delivered unto us in the clear light of the Spirit, and ſhould at the ſame time be under the mandato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power of the law as it was delivered in <hi>Sinai.</hi> It is impoſſible that a man ſhould in the Spirit doe good works freely, becauſe hee is juſtified, and yet doe good works that he may be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the law of <hi>Sinai</hi> doth command me to work that I may live and be juſtified: and in the covenant of grace I am informed that I am freely juſtified, &amp; therefore it is impoſſible that I ſhould be under grace, and under the manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory power of the law, as delivered in <hi>Sinai,</hi> at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Again, it is impoſſible that I ſhould do good works becauſe I ſee my ſelf free from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and doe good works, for feare of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:180666:17"/>But the law commandeth me to doe good works for feare of condemnation, &amp; the Goſpel, becauſe I am free from condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therfore it is impoſſible that I ſhould be under the Covenant of grace in ſpirit, and under the mandatory power of the law as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in <hi>Sinai.</hi> I ſhall draw the ſtrength of theſe arguments into a few words.</p>
               <p>Gods juſtified children are not under the commands of a Covenant of works.</p>
               <p>But the commands of the law as delivered in <hi>Sinai,</hi> are the commands of a Covenant of works.</p>

What an eaſie thing were it to gather many ſuch ſpeeches out of the bookes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern Writers, which may ſound as harſh to a tender eare as this doth? and doe yet make a delightfull ſound to the eare of Truth, as they lye in their bookes. To inſtance in a few: <hi>Ambroſe</hi> upon the 7. of the <hi>Romans</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:180666:19"/>hath theſe words. <hi>(Nec enim legis erit adulter, ſed Evangelij; qui mortuà lege vinctus Evangelio, poſt redit ad legem, Mortua enim lex dicitur cum ceſſat ejus authoritas.)</hi> Hee is not an adulterer by the law, but by the Goſpel, who being bound to the Goſpel, the law being dead, doth return unto the law: For the law is dead when its authority ceaſeth. And a little after this; <hi>(Mori legi, Deo eſt vivere,)</hi> To dye to the Law, is to live to God. <hi>Luther</hi> upon the 5. chap. of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> hath theſe words. <hi>(Habes pulcherimum et optimum librum omnium legum in corde tuo.

And by this pleaſant picture he maketh it contemptible in the conſcience, ſo that he that believeth in Chriſt doth now dare to inſult over the law by an holy kind of pride after this manner. I am a ſinner, if law thou canſt doe any thing againſt mee, doe it: ſo far is the formidability of the law from a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The like ſpeech is that of <hi>Zanchius,</hi> in his booke of the law of God. <hi>(Conſtat legem ſolis Judaeis datam fuiſſe, non autem gentibus.)</hi> It is manifeſt that the law was given only to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and not to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> A parallell place to this we have in <hi>Muſculus.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> is here the moſt hereticall of all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, his hereſie is un-heard of hereſie: becauſe he ſaith, <hi>that he who is dead to the Law, doth live to God.</hi> The falſe Apoſtles taught, <hi>unleſſe ye live to the Law, ye cannot live to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And afterwards, If thou wilt live to God, it behooveth thee to dye altogether to the law. Reaſon and humane wiſdome cannot receive
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:180666:21"/>this, and therefore it alwayes teacheth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto it: <hi>Si vis vivere Deo, oportet te omnino mori legi. Hanc doctrinam ratio, et ſapientia hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana non capit, ideo perpetuo contrarium docet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe he hath theſe words. When ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters doe apprehend that the Ceremoniall law is only abrogated, doe thou believe that <hi>Paul</hi> and every Chriſtian is abrogated to the whole law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cum ſophiſta intelligit legem abrogari, eamque ceremonialem, tu potius intellige Paulum &amp; quemli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet Chriſtianum univerſae legi abrogari.</hi>

               <p>I am dead to the law, that is, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Eſt autem mori legi, lege non tencri, ſed liberum eſſe a lege, et neſcire eam.)</hi> To be dead unto the law, is not to be held by the law, but to be free from the law, and not to know it.</p>

                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. If we preach conſolation, and doe exhort people to expect comfort from God, we may bid them put away the law, and their confidence of expecting comfort by it. <hi>The law worketh wrath,</hi> Rom. 7. and therefore it doth not worke joy. The ſpirit of joy is not received by the workes of the law, but by the hearing of faith. <hi>We receive the promiſe of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit through faith,</hi> Gal. 3.14.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:180666:22"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſ.</hi> 5. Though the law requireth holineſs, yet it doth not make us holy. A man that will be truely fanctified, muſt not live under the Law, but under the Goſpel. This is the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sinne ſhall not have dominion over you, becauſe ye are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, but under grace.</hi> Muſt not the law in ſome ſenſe be put away, that we may not be under it? Let my arguments be well weighed, and I am contented to be cenſured. In the meane while I ſhall comfort my ſelfe in this, that I am not the firſt of Saints, who have been reproached and perſecuted as an enemy to the law. The falſe witneſſes which were ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proto-martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> did bring in this againſt him, <hi>that he ſpake blaſphemous words againſt the law,</hi> Acts 6.13. And it is probable that ſome ſuch thing was charged upon <hi>Paul</hi> by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as we may gather by his defence for himſelfe before <hi>Feſtus,</hi> where he profeſſeth, <hi>that hee had not offended againſt the law of the Jewes,</hi> Acts 25.8. His propoſing and clearing objections ſo frequently in his Epiſtles, when he ſpeaketh of the Law and Goſpel, <hi>leſt hee ſhould be traduced as an enemie to the law,</hi> doth ſufficiently prove what was in the hearts and tongues of men who were oppoſers of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of free grace which he preached. I ſhall ſhut up my reply to this Artitle with the words
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180666:22"/>of this choſen Veſſell, ſpoken by him in the like caſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.14. <hi>This I confeſſe, that after the way which they call hereſie, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and the Prophets.</hi>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> When theſe Articles were brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, it being demanded of me, whether I would owne them as my tenents and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I doe well remember that I gave them this anſwer, after I had read them over. That I had made uſe of ſome phraſes and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were in that paper; and that ſome things which were therein being underſtood in a right ſenſe <hi>(ſano ſenſu)</hi> might paſſe for the bleſſed truths of the Lord Jeſus. But as they lay in the paper which was given unto me, ſo I did not own them as my tenents and opinions, becauſe thoſe things which were in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and diſcourſes, which held forth light for the underſtanding of them, were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with them in that paper. And that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer may more eſpecially reach theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:180666:23"/>words, I am not aſhamed to acknowledge, that in a Sermon I did make uſe of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſpeaking of the impoſſibility of our fulfilling the law for juſtification, the irritating power of the law, by which ſinne is ſtirred up in us, we by accident being made worſe by it, and while the law commandeth men who are under it, to yeild perſonall and perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto it, though it giveth us no power to doe what it commandeth us. And I doe not doubt but in the ſtrength of grace, I ſhall free the expreſſions from that horridneſſe which the Subſcribers following Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> have put upon it, or elſe I ſhall willingly acknowledg, that it was a raſh, inconſiderate, yea horrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which fell from me. But before I come to defend the innocency of the expreſſion, I cannot but ſtand ſtill a little and pauſe upon it, wondering that ſo many men who by their profeſſion, are tyed and engaged to the ſtudy of the Scriptures ſhould be ſo little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the language of the Scriptures, that they ſhould not be able to remember one Scripture expreſſion among ſo many which are like unto it, to free it from that horrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which they would put upon it.</p>
               <p>Friends, conſider what you doe; If ye cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my expreſſions as horrid, which the holy Spirit will juſtifie by the like expreſſions of his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:180666:23"/>owne in Scripture, take heed that ye doe not cenſure the Spirit as well as me, and ſtrike at the truth through my ſides. It is the ſpeech of <hi>Plutark. The thick clouds do often darken the Sun and the cloud of paſſions the light of reaſon.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> And thus I am apt to think it is with you. Your paſſions certainly are high, or elſe how could you be ſo low in your reaſons, ſo unadviſedly to condemn that as an horrid ſpeech? which by warrant from Scripture I ſhall prove to be harmleſſe. But in the firſt place, let us enquire where this horridneſſe doth lie. I am ready to believe that ye are not ſuch enemies to the law, to aſſert the latter part of the ſpeech hath any thing horrid in it? Yee will not ſay that it is horrid, to ſay that the law <hi>bids men to walke?</hi> The horrid treaſon then of the ſpeech muſt lye in the former part of it (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) I have found, I have found out the horridneſſe of it. It is horrid to affirme, <hi>that the law doth cut off a mans legges.</hi> Let us bring it to the bar of truth to be tryed: and if it cannot bring ſpeeches in Scripture, like unto it, where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is ſpeaking of the ſame points, which I handled when I delivered it: let it be ſtil bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the hot iron of the Subſcribers, and paſſe for an horrid errour.</p>

Now let the indifferent Reader judge, whether it be more horrid to ſay, <hi>that the law killeth a man,</hi> or <hi>cutteth off his legs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Friends, I am perſwaded that ſome of you have experimentally found, as I have done, <hi>that the law killeth.</hi> And when ye were ſlaine and killed by the law, were you freed preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the mandatory power of it? I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that ſome of you can profeſſe in truth with mee, that ye were not. <hi>The law then did command you to doe, and walke.</hi> What horrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is there more in this (if I may make the compariſon) to affirme, <hi>that the law cutteth off a mans legs, and then biddeth him to walke;</hi> then in this, To affirme <hi>that the law killeth a man, &amp; doth yet bid him to doe it and walke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the letter killeth,</hi> becauſe it giveth not ſtrength to fulfill it. (<hi>Litera occidit, nempe quia non conſert vires ad praeſtandum.)</hi>

Unleſſe the ignorant world muſt be made to believe, that my ſpeeches and exclamations are horrid and blaſphemous? I might multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply arguments from this Chapter, if I ſhould runne over all the expreſſions of the Apoſtle, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially theſe, where he calleth the law (<gap reason="foreign">

But that it may appeare that I ſpeake not this for the reproaching of you, but the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of wronged &amp; abuſed truth; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that a word is ſufficient to a wiſe man, when a thouſand ſtripes will not enter into a foole;</hi> I ſhall not inſult over your weakeneſſe, but rather co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, as farre as I may without injury to the truth. Let mee only leave this word to your conſideration, which in this place is very ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: to wit, That it is the mind of God that we ſhould be as favourable in interpreting the expreſſions of ſpirituall men in their writings and ſpeakings now, as in interpreting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of thoſe ſpirituall men, who are now
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:180666:25"/>with the Lord, knowing that they both ſpeak by the ſame ſpirit, which ſpirit doth retain his liberty to ſpeake in us, as it did in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Compare this ſpeech with that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. <hi>The motions of ſinne which were by the law,</hi> which will ſound as harſh as to affirme that the law doth cut off the legs of ſinners. But if ſome ſay this is only occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and accidentally, men running the more into ſinne, by how much the more they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to commit ſinne. According to that of the Poet. <hi>(Tendimus in vetitum)</hi> wee have a tendency in us to that which is forbidden. I anſwer, that the ſame expoſition will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently qualifie my ſpeech to take away from it the leaſt appearance of evill. The law doth cut off a mans legs occaſionally and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally. A man by reaſon of the corruption which is in him, findeth by experience that he is of leſſe ſtrength to run in the wayes of God, the more he doth endeavour to get ſtrength by the law of workes. <hi>Muſculus</hi> compareth it in this reſpect to a chaſte Matron in a Brothel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, which by her good advice doth prove an occaſion to ſome impudent whores to be more bold and ſhameleſſe in their impiety. Had the ſpirit of love (without which wee are nothing) taught you ſomething concerning this ſpeech, you would have been favourable in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:180666:25"/>interpreting it, and not rigidly cenſorious in condemning it. Oh that you who ſeeme to he zealous for the law, would conſider that this commandement, to wit, <hi>that we ſhould love our neighhour as our ſelves, is one of the great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, upon which all the Law and Prophets doe hang,</hi> Mat. 22.40: And then how would you dare to be ſo rigid and uncharitable in your cenſuring of your Brethren? If indeed you have received the law from <hi>Moſes,</hi> may I not ſay as my Saviour did to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> John 7.19. <hi>Did not</hi> Moſes <hi>give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth it.</hi> And then remember what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>That not the hearers</hi> (or preachers) <hi>of the law are juſt before God, but the doers of the law ſhall be juſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brethren, I am not ſuch an enemie to the law, but I can with freedome of ſpirit make uſe of that pertinent portion of Scripture unto you, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>If yee fulfill the royall law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture; Thou ſhalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe, yee doe well. But if ye have reſpect to perſons,</hi> (in your cenſuring &amp; judging them. And the ſame thing in effect, delivered by one man ſhall be accounted ſound by you, and ſhall be a horrid error if delivered by another man,) <hi>ye commit ſince, and are convinced of the law as tranſgreſſors.</hi>

                  <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 5.20. <hi>The law was given that the offence might abound.</hi> And then tell me whether there be not the ſame figure in my expreſſion, which is in <hi>Pauls.</hi> And why may I not make uſe of a figurative expreſſion, as well as <hi>Paul,</hi> expounding my meaning more plainly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as he doth, which I alſo did in my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, that by theſe words <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſimply ſignifie the encreaſing of the knowledge and pervicacy. <hi>(Deſignatur hic ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter incrementum notitiae et pervicaciae.)</hi> And another ſaith, that it it ſaid that it aboundeth by the law, becauſe it aboundeth in our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it <hi>(ut abundare agnoſcetur.)</hi> And will not this which is uſually ſpoken upon this place by Expoſitors, make our ſpeech paſſeable too? And as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the Commandement which was to life, he found to be unto death,</hi> Rom. 7.10. So may not I ſay, that the law which was for holy walking. I found to cut off my legs: becauſe being under it, I was no more able to walke in the way of it, than a man is able to walke without legs? I leave it to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall man who judgeth all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. to judge of this thing betweene us. And that you may not any farther to the diſhonour of God and your profeſſion, the prejudicing of the worke of the Lord in my Miniſtery, vent forth ſlanders and reproachas againſt me. I do
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:180666:26"/>profeſſe that I am not conſcious to my ſelfe of denying the uſe of the law in any way, in which it is held forth in the new Teſtament.

               <p>MAſter <hi>Gatakers</hi> fourth Article unto which he is brought in as a witneſſe by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers in the 17<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> page of their booke, is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God doth not chaſtiſe any of his children for ſinne: nor is it for the ſins of Gods people that the Land is puniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some few weekes for want of experimentall knowledge I was a little clouded in my ſpirit concerning the doctrine of affliction. And though God did ſhine into my ſoule at that time to give me a wonderfull light concerning the doctrine of free grace; yet I had not ſuch a cleer and truely ſpirituall knowledge of this point, as God did afterwards in the houre of tryall, temptation, and affliction give unto me. But though there was ſome hay and ſtubble in mee in this particular, and ſome miſ-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions concerning a place or two of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I have publiquely to my ſhame &amp; Gods glory acknowledged (though my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake was never charged upon me by my accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers) yet in my darkeſt and moſt cloudy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, I held forth enough to charitable and loving hearers to free me from this charge, and more fully to informe them of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between legall puniſhments, and fatherly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:180666:27"/>chaſtiſements. I then did preach that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were Gods fornace, in which he did take away that droſſe out of our lives and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he had taken away before by his grace through faith in our Juſtification. And afterward while I yet continued my preaching at <hi>Algate,</hi> before I was ejected from thence by the potency and prevalency of my opppoſers, in the Citie, (that I may ſpeake favourably of them.) To ſatisfie thoſe, whom I did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive did miſ-apprehend me; I did ſpeak from thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. <hi>As many as I love I rebuke and chaſten; be zealous therefore and amend.</hi> In the handling of which words for the better clearing of my meaning, I took liberty to handle two propoſitions ſeemingly contradictory.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That God doth not chaſtiſe his people for ſin, or from ſin.</hi>

                  <hi>That God doth chaſtiſe his people for ſinue and from ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this was the reaſon of my action. Not long before this I had preached, <hi>that God doth not puniſh his juſtified people for ſinne;</hi> From whence ſome concluded that I denied fatherly chaſtiſements to be for ſin. Wherefore that it might appear unto them, that they had not drawn good conſequences from my premiſes. I proved that theſe two. Propoſitions ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:180666:28"/>contradictory, might ſtand well together as two bleſſed truths of the Lord Jeſus: which thing I can prove by many witneſſes, and by ſome who did take the ſame Sermons <hi>verbatim</hi> in ſhort-hand. And I ſhall obſerve the ſame method in clearing of this thing, which is here charged upon me for my reproach.</p>
               <p>And that my meaning may more plainely appear, this Article having two branches in it, I ſhal ſpeak of them ſeverally.</p>
               <p>The firſt branch is, <hi>That God doth not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe any of his children for ſin.</hi> The word which I did uſually make uſe of, was <hi>puniſh,</hi> and not <hi>chaſtiſe.</hi> But if the word be taken in a large ſence, as ſometimes it is in Scripture, in which it ſignifieth as much as a legall puniſhment, properly ſo called: according to <hi>Iſaiah's</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace is upon him.</hi> I am willing to let it paſſe: and in this ſence hold it for a truth, <hi>That God doth not puniſh or chaſtiſe his people for ſin;</hi> which I ſhall further briefly prove for the ſatisfaction of the Reader by theſe arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The chaſtiſements or legall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due unto us for our ſins, cannot be laid upon us, which are laid upon Jeſus Chriſt for us.</p>
               <p>But theſe chaſtiſements or legall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due unto us for our ſins, are laid upon
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:180666:28"/>Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore they cannot be laid upon us.</p>
               <p>The firſt propoſition is evident, becauſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice doth not twice require ſatisfaction for the ſame fault, as the learned <hi>Davenant</hi> doth well prove it againſt the Papiſts in his determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Upon this poſition, that the ſinne being forgiven, the puniſhment is alſo forgiven. <hi>(Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſâ culpâ remittitur paena</hi>) where he affirmeth that if God ſhould puniſh ſin after it is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, he ſhould not exerciſe an act of Juſtice, but ſeverity, or his abſolute power. <hi>(Is non ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiae ſed ſaevitiae, aut ſaltem abſolutae potentiae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum exerceret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition is plainly proved by <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. God hath ſworn, <hi>that he will not be wroth with us, or rebuke us,</hi> Iſa. 54.9. And therefore hee doth not puniſh us with a legall puniſhment. For a legall puniſhment or chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſement is an effect of his wrath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. When God doth remember ſin no more, he doth not puniſh ſin with a legall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>But <hi>God doth not remember our ſins any more,</hi> Jer 31. Heb. 8.</p>
               <p>And therefore he doth not puniſh us with any legall puniſhment properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. God doth not puniſh us for thoſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:180666:29"/>ſins, from which we are cleanſed and purged by grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But we are purged and cleanſed from our ſinnes by grace,</hi> 1 John 1.7. Heb. 1.3. Apoc. 1.5.</p>
               <p>And therefore we are not puniſhed for our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. Believers when they are without fault, blame and reproofe in the ſight of God, cannot be puniſhed with any legall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Believers are without fault, blame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe in the ſight of God,</hi> Col. 1.22.</p>
               <p>And therefore they cannot be puniſhed with any legall puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. Beleivers cannot be puniſhed by God in his juſtice, as under the law when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be charged upon them.</p>
               <p>But nothing can be charged upon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.</p>
               <p>Therefore they cannot be puniſhed by the juſtice of God, as under the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. When God is fully appeaſed and ſatisfied for the ſins of believers by the ſacrifice of the death of Chriſt, he cannot then puniſh them with any legall chaſtiſement properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>But God is fully appeaſed and ſatisfied for the ſins of believers by the ſacrifice of the death of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:180666:29"/>
               <p>And therefore they cannot be puniſhed with any legal puniſhment properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. They for whom Chriſt is made a curſe, and hath freed from the curſe of the law, are not lyable to any puniſhment as a curſe.</p>
               <p>But for believers <hi>Chriſt was made a curſe, and hath freed them from the curſe of the law,</hi> Gal. 3.13.</p>
               <p>And therefore they are not lyable unto any puniſhment as it is a curſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. Sin, the cauſe of legall puniſhments being taken away, the effects of it are taken away.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt hath taken away finne which is the cauſe of legall puniſhments.</p>
               <p>And therfore he hath taken away the effects which are legall puniſhments: and therefore one ſpeaking of the afflictions of Saints, ſaith, that they are medicines, not puniſhments. <hi>(Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinae non paena naturam obtinent.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of this argument is built upon the known axiome. The cauſe being taken away, the effect is taken away. <hi>(Sublatâ cauſâ tolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur effectus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. That being taken away, which doth binde over a man to legall puniſhment, the legall puniſhment is taken away.</p>
               <p>But guilt which bindeth a man over to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:180666:30"/>puniſhment is taken away.</p>
               <p>And therefore the legall puniſhment is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 11. God doth as fully forgive us our treſpaſſes, as he would have us to forgive the treſpaſſes of men againſt us.</p>
               <p>But when we do forgive their treſpaſſes, we are not afterward to inflict any vindicative puniſhment upon them.</p>
               <p>And therefore God doth ſo fully forgive us our treſpaſſes, that hee doth not afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict any vindicative puniſhment. This is the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a learned writer, <hi>(Deus debita noſtra non minus gratuito, et plene nobis dimittit quam docuit nos debitoribus noſtris dimittere.)</hi> God ſaith he, doth no leſſe freely and ſully forgive us our debts, than he would have us to forgive our debters.</p>
               <p>I might multiply ſentences of Writers, who with one conſent do under-write to this truth. <hi>Polanus</hi> ſaith, That they who are temporally puniſhed for ſin here, are to be puniſhed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. <hi>(Qui temporaliter puniuntur in aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num puniendi ſunt.)</hi> And that chaſtiſement is not ſo much for the purging of ſins paſt, as to teach to avoid ſin for the future. (<hi>Non adhibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur pro purgandis praeteritis peccatis, ſed pro futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris vitandis,</hi> Pol. ſynt. l. 6. c. 4. <hi>Willet</hi> hath many ſpeeches to this purpoſe in his Synopſis. <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:180666:30"/>writing on this point againſt the Papiſts, ſaith; what is it to remit the ſin or the fault, then not to puniſh a man any more for it. <hi>(Quid aliud eſt peccatum ſive culpam remittere quam illud ad poenam hand amplius imputare.)</hi> But I ſtudy brevity, knowing how diſtaſtfull long controverſies are to the pallats of men of theſe times. And therefore in few words to put a period to what I intend to ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt branch of this Article, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that man may be conſidered two manner of wayes:</p>
               <p>Firſt, as hee is in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo all afflictions are properly puniſhments, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the law unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly.</hi> In the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> and thus the nature of afflictions and chaſtiſements for ſinne are changed unto him. The ſting is taken out of death, and every affliction. Afflictions are benedictions to him. (<hi>Afflictiones benedictiones,</hi> Bern.) Not curſes, but bleſſings unto him. And therefore 2<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> God will chaſten his juſtified people in his fatherly love to them, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt ſinne, that they may be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his holineſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. by the ſpirit of ſanctification; as they are partakers of Chriſts righteouſneſſe in their Juſtification; which maketh true Saints not only <hi>to beare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions patiently, but to glory in tribulation,</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:180666:31"/>Rom. 5.3. And though in a ſence they are afflicted neither for ſin, that it is not to ſatisfie Gods juſtice, which is already ſatisfied by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, nor from ſin (as ſome ſpeak;) <hi>for the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> Yet God doth afflict us, that in the afflictions he may powre forth his Spirit upon us, for the removing of ſin out of our ſpirits, which doth grieve his Spirit: and out of our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, which doth diſhonour his name. And for the preventing of ſinne for the future; the Prodigall will take heed how hee doth runne from his Fathers houſe, when hee hath beene among the Swine. And the ſoule beloved of Chriſt, when ſhe is forſaken of all lovers, and in miſery, will reſolve to returne unto her firſt love, and ſay, <hi>for then was it better with me than now,</hi> Hoſ. 2.7. And thus much briefly by way of anſwer to the firſt branch of this Article.</p>
               <p>The ſecond branch of this article is this; <hi>That the Land is not puniſhed for the ſins of Gods people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What hath been ſpoken concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent branch of this Article for the clearing of this. As no legall puniſhment properly ſo called, can be inflicted upon the perſon of a believer for his ſinne; ſo no puniſhment can be inflicted upon the Land in which he liveth for his ſinnes. Yet I doe not deny, but that God
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:180666:31"/>who puniſheth the unjuſtified perſons of a land in his wrath, for their rebellions and tranſgreſſions, may chaſtiſe ſome of his people by a nationall calamity and affliction for their humiliation and reformation. But though in a nationall viſitation, the ſame affliction, if it be materially conſidered, may be laid upon a believer, which is laid upon unbelievers; yet the affliction which is laid upon a Saint is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally diſtinguiſhed from that which is infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon unjuſtified perſons; the one flowing from the love of a Father, the other from the wrath of an enemie. The leaſt of theſe is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, materially &amp; formally a legall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other materially a judgment or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: but formally a fatherly chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a pledg of Gods love to a Saint.</p>

               <p>THere is yet one Article more which the Subſcribers have taken out of Mr. <hi>Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> page 16. <hi>That if a man by the Spirit know himſelfe to be in the ſtate of grace, though hee be drunke, or commit murther, God ſees no ſinne in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I ſhould but name the man who brought in this Article againſt me, it were enough to acquit me from the charge, in the judgment of thoſe who know him. But I am reſolved that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:180666:32"/>the world ſhall ſee, that I ſtudy not revenge, but the clearing and vindication of truth in my anſwer.</p>
               <p>When one in the Star-chamber demanded of me, whether an Article ſomething like unto this were my tenet, and whether I had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it in ſuch words. I did reply, that I might affime of it, what <hi>Martiall</hi> did of his poem, that it was his, as made, compoſed, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by him: but it ceaſed to be his, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the repeaters, when it was evilly repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by another. <hi>(Sed male dum recitas incipit eſſe tuum.)</hi> So the truth contained in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, to wit, <hi>That God ſees no ſinne in his juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed children</hi> in the ſence in which I delivered it, it is my tenet, or rather Gods truth.</p>
               <p>But while it is repeated with ſome words of the accuſer, to bring an <hi>odium</hi> upon the truth, and that being not mentioned which was largely laid downe in my diſcourſe to give light unto it; I doe affirm that it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be the accuſers own.</p>
               <p>The ground of this Article was my prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching plainly of this truth, <hi>That God doth not ſee any ſinne in his juſtified children;</hi> which is a truth which I hope to maintain unto death. I ſhall therefore acquaint the Reader with my ſence of the words. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. with ſome reaſons which I have laid downe to demonſtrate it to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:180666:32"/>be a truth. 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. In what ſence I do conceive it to be an errour, which I hope will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfie the intelligent Reader, and cleanſe mee from the filth and guilt, which is caſt, and charged upon mee by the Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When I preach <hi>that God ſeeth no ſin in his juſtified children;</hi> my meaning is in reference to Juſtification. God ſeeth his ſin, guilt, and puniſhment laid &amp; charged upon Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore cannot ſee any ſinne in him: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſweete and elegant ſpeech of <hi>Hierom.</hi> That ſaith he, which is covered, is not ſeene; that which is not ſeene, is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; that which is not imputed, ſhall not be puniſhed. <hi>(Quod tegitur non vidertur; quod non videtur non imputatur; quod non imputatur non punietur.)</hi> And the ſame truth is laid downe by Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> whom you all will acknowledge to be a faithfull &amp; ſound writer; by whoſe Treatiſe entitled <hi>The life of faith.</hi> The Lord was pleaſed to beame in at my firſt converſion, ſome Goſpel-light into my ſoule, while I was endeavouring to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh my owne righteouſneſſe. The words following are to be found in the 9. chap. of the life of faith, <hi>pag.</hi> 85. What ſaith he if God looke upon the hand-writing againſt us: doth be not ſee the bills cancelld with the precious
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:180666:33"/>blood of his Sonne and our ſurety? which for matter of guilt, defilement and puniſhment, is ſufficient to expunge, cover, nullifie, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and wholly to take away our ſins in ſuch ſort, that he neither ſees, will ſee, nor can ſee them as ſins, and debts, bearing action againſt us, obliging us to any penalty.</p>
               <p>I might heap up places out of the bookes of the faithful which have ſubſcribed to the ſame truth, in the ſame or the like words. There is no phraſe ſo commonly uſed by <hi>Luther</hi> in his Commentary upon the <hi>Galatians,</hi> as this, <hi>that God ſeeth no ſin in his children.</hi> But becauſe the teſtimonie of men to truth is of no authority with my ſelfe, conſidering that we ſhould not conſider ſo much who it is that ſpeaketh, as what is ſpoken. (<hi>Non quis ſed quid,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Salv.</hi>) I ſhall not burthen the page with quotations out of Writers: but ſhall rather preſent unto you ſome grounds from Scripture; by which it will appeare that in a Scripture-ſence God may be ſaid <hi>to ſee no ſin in his children.</hi>

               <p>For theſe and many other reaſons which might be produced, it may be truly ſaid, that God ſeeth no ſin in his juſtified people. And therefore Chriſt ſpeaking of his juſtified Church, ſaith, <hi>That his Love is all faire, and

Let it not be reported abroad for the ſhame of Religion, that ever any man or men were ſo uſed in this Kingdom.

               <p>THus far in anſwer to the Subſcribers of the new Province. I might here make an end, but that I finde ſomething yet behind in their witneſſe, which they have not publiſhed, upon what grounds I know not. It may not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that they are more affraid of this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie in theſe things, than in thoſe articles they have borrowed from him, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his fellow Subſcribers of the Synod; which may diſcover what an excellent and fit witneſſe Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> is in this buſineſſe.

               <p>One thing I am ſure of, that thoſe who greſly a buſe them, who taking their riſe from <hi>Luthers</hi> application of them, with ſome harſh expreſſions unto Chriſt, ſtrain them ſo farre, as to diſſwade Chriſtian people from troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves about confeſſion of their ſins, as being enough for them to believe, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:180666:37"/>Chriſt here hath confeſſed them for them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Maſter <hi>Simpſon</hi> preaching on that Text—</p>
               <p>Sir, If God had given you grace to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly thought upon that place in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi> 25.18. <hi>A man that beareth falſe witneſſe againſt his neighbour, is a maul, and a ſword, &amp; a ſharp arrow.</hi> You would not ſo ſuddenly and raſhly have come forth as a witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mee in print concerning this thing; when you your ſelfe doe preſently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it is not ſo clear or certain as thoſe others are before aſſedged. Doe you walke according to the rules of purity, to publiſh fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reports againſt the ſervants of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you give them any notice of it, or enquire fully concerning the truth of them? Can you juſtifie your practiſe before the Lord Jeſus, before whom you and I muſt appear; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame me ſo much in print, before you did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cure mee by one word of your mouth, or line of your hand, if I had been infected with errour. The Apoſtle comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us who are ſpirituall, <hi>That if any man be overtaken with a fault, to reſtore ſuch a one in the ſpirit of meekeneſſe,</hi> Gal. 6.1. When the cry of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> was great and grievous, the Lord went down to ſee whether they had done according to the cry of it. And when
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:180666:38"/>this cry came unto you concerning me, you might have done well according to the will of God, to have imitated God, and to have que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried whether it were according to the cry: and I could have ſent you divers godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at that time, who ſhould have taken an oath of it, if it had been lawfully given them, that I delivered things oppoſite and contrary to what you have preſented to the world, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then what you affirme that I ſaid. I ſhall therefore crave leave to give a true report un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world of that which I have delivered concerning this thing; not ſeeking your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, but endeavouring to free my ſelfe and the truth from the diſcredit which you have brought upon us by your falſe relation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I doe acknowledge that at <hi>Wapping</hi> I ſpake from theſe words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Innumerable evills have compaſſed me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to looke up, they are more than the haires of my head, therefore my heart fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth mee.</hi> And in the opening of them I did affirme that if any ſhould aske me as the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch did <hi>Philip,</hi> Acts 8.34. <hi>Of whom ſpeaketh the Prophet this; of himſelfe or of ſome other man?</hi> I ſhould anſwer that it would be plain that he did prophetically ſpeak of Jeſus Chriſt; if the Holy-Ghoſt might be heard as an Expoſitor;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:180666:38"/>and if wee did interpret Scripture by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is the beſt way of interpreting Scripture.</p>
               <p>The place which I made uſe of for the proofe of this, is in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. where the Apoſtle doth apply the precedent words unto Jeſus Chriſt. And whereas you ſay that I did take my riſe from <hi>Luthers</hi> application of them with ſome harſh expreſſions unto Chriſt. I doe affirme that this is altogether falſe. For it was then unknowne unto mee, that <hi>Luther</hi> had ever expounded them ſo. God hath taught me better, then that I ſhould make <hi>Luther</hi> my rule for interpreting of Scripture. I have learned to call no man maſter but Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>(Nullius aſtrictus jurare in verba Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtri.) Luther</hi> is not of greater authority with me than Maſter <hi>Gataker,</hi> farther than I doe apprehend that he ſpeaketh according to the truth of God, and meaning of Scripture. If I had had a deſire to have perſwaded the people that I preached the truth of God unto them from the authority of Expoſitors, it had been an eaſie thing to have ſtuffed my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with quotations drawn from them, and not to have made uſe of <hi>Luthers</hi> only. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and moderne Writers have uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the words, as I did. <hi>Muſculus</hi> ſaith that all the Ancients doe expound this of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:180666:39"/>Chriſt, not that our ſins are properly his, but by diſpenſation, as hee was a Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the Father. <hi>(Hoc veteres omnes ita de Chriſto exponunt, ut noſtra peccata ſint ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius non proprie ſed diſpenſatione, quâ ſe mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem inter nos et patrem obtulit.) Pomeranus</hi> ſaith, that iniquities take hold of Chriſt, not which he himſelfe had committed, but which he had taken upon himſelfe. <hi>(Chriſtum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenderunt iniquitates ſuae non quas fecerat, ſed quas pro nobis ſuſceperat diluendas.)</hi> And thus I then expounded the words, according to that of <hi>Fulgentius.</hi> Hee that had no ſinne of his owne, did beare ours. <hi>(Qui non habuit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria portavit aliena.)</hi> Chriſt did acknowledg that they were his ſinnes, not becauſe they were inheſively in him, but becauſe they were imputed unto him. Hee was contented that they ſhould be charged upon him, that wee might be diſcharged from them. I am not the firſt who have aſſerted that Chriſt hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that our ſinnes are his, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But whereas you would make your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der believe, that upon this account I would wholly take away confeſſion of ſinne, this I doe deny. And I can prove that the maine uſe of this Sermon was to teach believers how they ſhould in an Evangelicall way confeſſe ſinne over the head of the Scape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goat,

I doe think that if the Devill himſelfe ſhould get up into a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit to preach, who doth often preach by his Vicars and Curates;) that he would not make uſe of any ſuch exhortation. Neither did ever any man but your ſelfe, aver the ſame thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:180666:40"/>mee. I doe confeſſe that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle was brought in againſt me, that I ſhould deliver in a Sermon theſe words; <hi>Let Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſinne as faſt as they will, there is a fountaine open for them to waſh in.</hi> But it being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome, whether I did deliver it by way of exhortation: the accuſer was ſo ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to acknowledge that it was not delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as an exhortation: And therefore it is probable that your Brethren of the new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, have had ſo much grace to leave it out in their charge (though it be in the ſame page in which they have taken out the other Articles:) and it will be for your credit more then for mine, to leave it out in your next Edition: You may as well take out that part of a verſe in <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.11. <hi>He that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill: and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill;</hi> and conclude that God in Scripture exhorteth men to be unjuſt and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as to draw out ſcraps and fragments out of my diſcourſes, to perſwade the world that I in my preaching exhort people to commit ſin, which I doe deſire to deſtroy in my ſelfe, and thoſe who heare mee, by preaching the grace of God in Chriſt. Your learning, if not love, might have taught you to have put a more favourable conſtruction upon theſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:180666:41"/>words. The word <hi>let,</hi> is not always uſed by way of exhortation, as appeares by thoſe words, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. But ſometimes by way of ſuppoſition, and doth frequently ſignifie as much as the word <hi>though</hi> doth. And take it in this ſence, it is as ſeaſonable a truth, as I can in deſire of your good, leave upon your ſpirit. Though you, who profeſſe your ſelfe a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, have ſinned as faſt as you can in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, againſt the lawes of love, and the Commandements of the Lord Jeſus; yet there is a fountaine opened, in which, if God give you faith, you may waſh your ſelfe from theſe ſins. In the meane while I ſhall comfort my ſelfe, that there is nothing charged upon mee, but the ſame hath beene charged upon thoſe who were more filled with the Spirit for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching then I am.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are two things which men ought chiefly to know; Their miſery by ſin; and their happineſſe by the grace of God in Chriſt. And by the wicked unfaithfulneſſe of our memories wee are more apt to forget theſe two things, then to forget any other points whatſoever. [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>Know thy ſelfe,</hi> is a leſſon as difficult, as it is old and common. How hard a matter is it for a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180666:43"/>man to remember himſelfe, as to know what he is in himſelfe? The King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> thought it needfull, that his Page ſhould every morning put him in remembrance, that he was a mortall man. And every ſpirituall man doth finde it neceſſary, that the Spirit daily ſhould become his remembrancer, to put him in mind that he is a ſinful man. So likewiſe it is a hard matter, without the power, &amp; aſſiſtance of the Spirit, alwayes to know, the rich, full, and free grace of God, as it is held forth in the Goſpel to poore ſinners. The laſt of theſe, as it is the moſt ſweet and excellent leſſon, ſo with the greater difficultie it is retained in our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. This is a Doctrine, which if it were prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto us every day, wee ſhould forget it every day. The daily teaching and hourely learning of it, cannot wholly free us from the ignorance of this truth. But as farre as we are carnall and fleſhly, wee are ſtrangers to the knowledge of it. So that he that thinkes he perfectly knowes the doctrine of juſtification by faith alone, I dare profeſſe to that man, that he knows nothing of this doctrine of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification as he ought to know. As long as we live upon the earth, we may be learners of this doctrine. <hi>Paul</hi> after he had been a ſcholler, and an aged teacher in the ſchoole of Chriſt many yeares, did then profeſſe, that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180666:43"/>to forget his own workes, and legall righteouſneſſe, in reference to his juſtification, and preſſed forward to know more of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Chriſt, labouring to be found in the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10.</p>
               <p>Therefore though I have formerly ſpoken of the chiefe point that lieth in theſe verſes; yet I know it is needfull and neceſſary for mee to ſpeake of it againe, that you that have heard it opened, may heare more of it, as well as for thoſe, who have not heard the point ſo clearly &amp; fully unfolded unto them; to whom God may make my diſcourſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, if he accompany mee with his preſence. Wherefore I have pitched upon this ſubject at this preſent: in which, the ſumme of all divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is comprized. For faith and love is the ſumme of all that we preach: Faith towards the Lord Jeſus, and love towards God, and all thoſe that are united to him in the ſame Spirit with our ſelves. And the Apoſtle lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down both theſe in theſe verſes: ſhewing firſt clearly the doctrine of juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through faith alone without works; and then ſhewing that though we are juſtified without workes, yet how in the Spirit wee are carried forth to performe all good works; for, he ſaith, <hi>Wee are created the workmanſhip of God unto good works,</hi> ver. 10.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:180666:44"/>
               <p>In theſe words, theſe particulars preſent themſelves to your beſt attentions.</p>
               <p n="1">Firſt, that ſalvation and juſtification is by grace, that is, by the free favour of God; <hi>Tee are ſaved by grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, He ſheweth how we are ſaved by grace; in a way of beleeving, not working; <hi>Yee are ſaved by grace through faith.</hi> Many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they look on grace, but it is thorough the ſpectacles of their own works: but he that doth truly eye grace, he looks on grace in an act of beleeving, and not through working.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, The Apoſtle diſcovers the nature of true faith, which is the unfained faith of the Elect. Firſt, negatively he informeth us, that this faith is not of our ſelves; There is not a fountain in our ſelves, from whence a true and lively faith ſprings; it floweth not from the naturall, carnall, or rationall principles of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but from the power of the Spirit of grace. Secondly, affirmatively he inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us concerning the nature and originall of it; it proceedeth from God, and is beſtowed upon the creature as a free gift: It is not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God.</p>
               <p n="4">Fourthly, He ſhews that as it is by grace, ſo it is not by works; as it is by beleeving, ſo it is not by working: <hi>Not of works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">Fiftly, He gives the reaſon why it is not by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180666:44"/>works; <hi>Leaſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> If a man could ſay, that God hath juſtified, and ſaved him for his endeavours, labours, paines, or good workes, then a man might boaſt. When he meeteth with one that is without Chriſt, he may ſay, I have done this good worke, and the other good worke for Chriſt, I ſhall be ſaved, and thou ſhalt be damned. But the true childe of God, if he meet with a reprobate, he ſees no cauſe to boaſt; it is by the grace of God that he is ſaved, when the other is damned. <hi>Not by works, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> It is the deſigne and intention of God, in juſtifying a ſinner by grace without works, to keepe men from pride and boaſting. Man did fall from happineſſe by pride; there is no way to attaine happineſſe, but by humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and faith; the true way to humilitie is by beleeving; for beleeving empties the creature of all works, and righteouſneſſe, and ſhewes that he is nothing in himſelfe, and that all his treaſure, glory, happineſſe, riches, and perfection, lies treaſured, and laid up in another. <hi>(Fides hominem vacuum Deo adducit, ut Chriſti bonis impleatur)</hi> Faith bringeth a man in a poore and beggerly condition to Chriſt, that he may be enriched by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Apoſtle declareth, that though we are ſaved by faith without works, yet wee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180666:45"/>ſhall not be unfruitfull, in bringing forth good works. Wee are the workmanſhip of God by a new creation. And the end of our creation in Chriſt, is this, that being in him we may be active to love and good works.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall endeavour to prove negatively, that there is no juſtification by works. And then ſhew how it is by grace; and then how it is in a way of beleeving; and ſo come to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh true faith, which is given by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, from the falſe faith of hypocrites, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines, which floweth onely from a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of humane wiſdome, and not from the powerfull operation of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>At this preſent, I ſhall obſerve this method.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will ſhew that we are not ſaved by works, I meane, by the works of the Law.</p>
               <p>Then I ſhall ſhew, that wee are not ſaved, and juſtified by works, which are the fruits of faith, or done under the Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſhew, that we are not ſaved by works, in which wee yeeld obedience to any Goſpel Ordinances, though they be Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces appointed by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be practiſed by the Saints. I take in this, becauſe I have found in my own ſpirit, and in many that I have dealt with, a ſecret and ſubtle kinde of Poperie, by which wee are apt to attribute ſomething to the practiſe of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180666:45"/>Ordinances, in reference to our juſtification. And hence it is that people are ſo ready to run into every new way of worſhip, which is brought to light, thinking that unleſſe they finde out the right diſcipline, and government of Jeſus Chriſt, the right Baptiſme, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, they are not true Saints, nor ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtified. Therefore I ſhall take in this too, to ſhew, that as wee are not juſtified by more inward, and ſpirituall works; ſo neither are wee juſtified by any outward obſervation of Ordinances, or ſubmitting to any command of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but onely by our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the firſt and principall command of the Goſpel, by which we beleeve juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by grace through Chriſt without works.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe heads, I ſhall briefly ſhew, how it is not by works, paſſing by many things that I have formerly ſpoken of, and I ſhall onely lay down foure or five conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the confirming of this, that wee are ſaved, and juſtified before God, and in the Court of our own conſcience, without any works whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The firſt conſideration may be this; Wee cannot be juſtified by works, or by the Law: becauſe there was never any man had a legall righteouſneſſe, but the man Chriſt Jeſus. This is <hi>Pauls</hi> undeniable concluſion, laid down in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:180666:46"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>All have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi> The devout Jew as well as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Gentile, is brought in, before the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of God, as a guiltie finner, coming ſhort of ſuch a glorious righteouſneſſe, which the Law doth require of him, that he may be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied under it. The Gentile never walked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the written Law of nature, which is written in his heart, nor the Jew, according to the Law of his Maker, written in Tables of ſtone.</p>
               <p>All the works of the Law may be reduced to two heads.</p>
               <p>The firſt are thoſe works that wee doe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, to ſhew our love to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The works that we doe, to ſhew our love to our neighbour.</p>
               <p>Now if we take works, in either of theſe two reſpects, I ſhall ſhew, that all the men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the world, come ſhort of ſuch a legall righteouſneſſe, and perfection, that the holy, juſt, and pure Law of God requires.</p>
               <p>It will be cleare, that no man ever loved God as he ought. God doth command us, that wee ſhould love him with all our heart, and with all our ſtrength, with the whole ſtreame of our affections. But what man did ever love God in that manner? Suppoſe a wife ſhould entertaine many thouſand lovers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:180666:46"/>her husband, could any ſay, that that wife loved her husband? So many fins as wee have, ſo many lovers we have, ſo the Scripture cals them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Thou haſtplayed the harlot with many lovers:</hi> that is, thou haſt followed many ſins and luſts, baſe and vile corruptions. Now it is thus with all the men in the world; wee have all gone a whoring from our God; ſo that though all men, yea even Turks and Heathens pretend to love God, the great God that made them, yet there is no man that ever loved God as he ought. That man that thinks that he ever loved God as he ought, and as the Law requires, he is very blind, and not enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this day, to ſee the puritie, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie of the righteous Law of the juſt and high God.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a Subject ſhould alway contrive rebellion, and conſpire againſt the perſon of his King, as deſirous to take away his life, and to pull the Crowne from his head; will any ſay, that this Subject loves the King, Thus it is with all men; wee are all traytors and rebells againſt the King of Heaven; if we had ſtrength, we would take the Crowne from the head of God, and ſet it upon the head of the Devill. If it were in our power, God ſhould not reigne, and be King in the world, but the Devill. This is in the heart of wicked fleſh, it brings forth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:180666:47"/>nothing elſe; it loves it ſelf, and the devill, but hates, loaths, and abhorres God, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the Devill ſhould ſit on the throne, then God the Father, and the Lambe at his right hand. So that a man being unable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Law of God, God cannot juſtifie him by his Law, but muſt pronounce him a rebell; for ſin is rebellion, and ſpirituall high treaſon againſt God. In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. when God ſent the Prophet to teach the people, he tells him what people he ſhould meet with, he ſaith they were ſuch as would not heare him, ſuch as would ſleight him, and would not indure to heare ſound and good doctrine, and calleth them rebells. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, Son of man, I ſend thee to the children of Iſrael, to a rebellious Nation, that have rebelled againſt me, even to this very day.</hi> You ſee, ſinne is called rebellion in the Word of God.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, certainly, I was never ſuch a rebell as you make me; I apprehend not that I ever hated God in ſuch a manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If thou doſt not ſee how thou ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreſt God, and how in the fleſh thou loveſt the Devill more then God, thou haſt not to this day, a ſight of the juſt and pure will of God. For it is not enough that thou abſtaine from groſſe ſins and prophaneneſſe, that makes a man ſcandalous to the eye of the world;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:180666:47"/>but thou muſt abſtaine from every ſin, from every vaine thought, or elſe the Law will paſſe the ſentence of condemnation on thee as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell. If it were poſſible that a man could ſo live on earth, that he ſhould never diſhonour God in any action; that he ſhould never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God by any word of his mouth; but all his words ſhould be to the glory of that God that made him, and to the glory of that wiſdome of the Father, by which he made all things: yet if this man ſhould have but a ſinfull ungodly riſing in his heart againſt God, the Law would take no notice of all the good deeds of this man, &amp; all the good words that he hath ſpoken to the glory of God, but the Law would condemne him for that ſinfull thought in his ſpirit. Therefore you ſhall finde that not onely ſinfull words and actions, are called trayterous words, and rebellious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Scripture, but evill thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, are treaſon againſt God; the Law of God reacheth the heart &amp; ſpirit of a man, ſo that if there be a ſinfull thought, the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and holy Law of God condemnes a man as a rebell for that thought. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.23. <hi>This people hath a revolting, and rebellious heart.</hi> The Law doth not condemne a man onely for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in words and actions, but for rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the heart. It is not enough for us out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:180666:48"/>to conform to what the Law requires, but we muſt have obedient hearts; if there be any rebellion in the heart, we are condemned, as though wee had ſinned againſt God in words and actions.</p>
               <p>The Law doth not only condemn a man for adultery, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he defiles his neighbours wife. A man may be an adulterer, and yet an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch; if a man have but an adulterous glance with his eye at the ſight of a woman, if he have but a ſinfull thought ariſing in his heart, the glorious Law of God thunders in the face of that man, and lightens in the countenance of that man, and will utterly deſtroy him for his ſin. The Law is like the Prieſt and Levite, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. that paſt by the man which was rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and wounded by theeves. It is Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone who powreth in the oyle of his Goſpel into the wounds of ſinners, for to heale and refreſh them. The Law rightly and ſpiritually underſtood, is a Miniſtery of death (<hi>Languorem oſtendi, non aufert,</hi> Aug.) It is the Goſpel which is the Miniſtery of life and ſalvation. And if we thus look upon the Law of God, &amp; rightly underſtand it, it is cleare and evident, that there was never any man that loved God. Sin is a hatred of God, ſo many ſins as thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteſt, ſo much hatred of God thou diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Our love is ſhewed by keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:180666:48"/>of God; ſo by breaking the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, we diſcover and manifeſt that hatred that is in us againſt the moſt holy God. So that if you conſider this, that you never loved God yet; you cannot comfort your ſelves in your love to God; but muſt abaſe your ſelves for your neglecting of the doctrine of juſtification. When God ſhall give you light to ſee himſelf, and his Son, you will find, that that which you call love to God, (in your blind ignorance,) is hatred of God, and rebellion againſt him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider, that there is no man that ever loved his neighbour as he ought. The Law of nature, and the written Law of God require, that every man ſhould doe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as he would that they ſhould do to him: But there was never any man that did ſo. If it were poſſible for a man to live ſo, as that he ſhould never wrong his neighbour, or his brother, by any unjuſt action, or by any word ſpoken againſt his brother. But where is the man that can ſtand forth, and truly affirme it? yet he may be charged by the Law, if he hath had any evil thoughts againſt him in his heart. For the Law is ſpirituall, the Law reacheth the heart; and the Law will condemne this man, as a man that hates his brother; for the Law takes notice of this, in this particular: As
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:180666:49"/>you ſhall find, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Oppreſſe not the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, nor the fatherleſſe, nor the poore, and let none of you imagine evill in your hearts againſt his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> The Law forbids imagining evill againſt our brother in our hearts. So that if once in all the dayes of thy life, thou haſt had but one uncharitable thought of any man, when thou hadſt no ground at all for it, thou haſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined evill in thy heart againſt thy brother, and art a tranſgreſſor of the Law; for thou walkeſt contrary to thy rule and light.</p>
               <p>I appeale to thee, wouldeſt thou have a man think evill of thee, when he hath no juſt cauſe? Thou wilt ſay, I would have no man thinke evill of me, or harbour an unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thought in his breaſt againſt me: ſo then if thou have an uncharitable riſing in thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt any man or woman in the world, thou comeſt ſhort of the righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, and perfection of the Law, and ſo there is no ſalvation for thee by the Law: If a man conſider what the Law is, he ſhall find no comfort in the world by looking upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his beſt performances in the glaſſe of the Law; but he ſhall find that all have ſinned, are haters of God, fighters againſt God, haters of his children, and enemies to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. That as Chriſt ſaid to the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Did not Moſes give you a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:180666:49"/>Law, and none of you keepe it?</hi> So I may ſpeake to all men and women in the world; the juſt and righteous God, as the creator that may require obedience from his creature, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us a juſt and holy Law; all that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is conſonant to reaſon and equitie. Thou canſt not deny, but that it is equall that thou ſhouldeſt doe to all men, as thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt that they ſhould doe to thee. But we have all ſinned, and have broken this juſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Law of God; therefore by this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that there is no juſtification for a man by the Law, or his own works.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another Conſideration may be drawne from this; it is not any whit neceſſary, that any man ſhould have any works at all, to bring with him unto God for his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is a fulneſſe and ſufficiency in the grace of God, and in Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that there is no need of any works that we ſhould bring for our juſtification.</p>
               <p>The robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, is ſuch a compleat garment, that there needs no pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of our own to be ſowed to it. You ſhall find God ſpeaking of his own grace in <hi>Iſaiah, Iſa.</hi> 43. <hi>For mine own Names ſake, I will forgive thy ſinnes, and will remember thy iniquities no more.</hi> It is not for our works ſake, if it be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his grace. He ſaith, <hi>His arme is mightie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:180666:50"/>and ſtrong.</hi> As the arme of Gods juſtice, is a mightie arme, by which he cruſhes, and breaks in pieces all wicked, and ungodly men; ſo his arme is mightie to bring ſalvation. <hi>And he hath laid help upon one that is mightie,</hi> Pſal. 89. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mightineſſe of Gods arme is to bring ſalvation to his people, he is mightie to ſave, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. and he will ſave to the utmoſt, the worſt, and chiefe of ſinners, without any righteouſneſſe, or holineſſe of their owne. Therefore it followes, that it is not needfull, nor neceſſary, that a man doe good works, that he may be juſtified, and ſaved.</p>
               <p>We have a rule in Philoſophy, that it is vaine &amp; frivolous to doe that by many things, that may be done by few; ſeeing God hath diſcovered an alſufficiency in his own grace, it is vaine therefore to ſeek juſtification by many things. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.7. <hi>There is mercy with God, and plenteous redemption:</hi> No need therefore of mans righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>If thou haſt been a ſlave to many ſinnes, to vile luſts, and baſe corruptions; pride, vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, hypocriſie, ſwearing, and uncleanneſſe, &amp;c. <hi>There is plenteous redemption.</hi> God can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme thee from all thy ſinnes, that thou haſt been accuſtomed unto many yeares. He is able to redeeme thee out of the hands of all thy corruptions, that hold thee faſt in bondage
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:180666:50"/>and ſlavery. Wherefore there being ſuch a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in grace, it is not needfull or neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that a man doe good works, that he may be juſtified.</p>
               <p>The fourth conſideration may be this; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God doth not require us to doe good works that they ſhould juſtifie or ſave us. I confeſſe in the letter of the Word, God ſeemes to require them. When he ſpeaks in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Law, he ſaith, <hi>Doe this, and live, &amp;c.</hi> But in the Miniſtery of the Goſpel, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the only Miniſtery of ſalvation, God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thee to do any thing that thou maiſt be ſaved, or juſtified. The Law ſets thee to work, and is never ſatisfied; but the Goſpel bids thee doe nothing at all. This is the tenour of the Goſpel, Beleeve in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and be confident to be juſtified onely by his Name. The Apoſtles when they preached, endeavoured to beat men off, from their own works and performances, in the point of juſtification. When the Gaoler ſaid; <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved? Paul</hi> bids him not to work, but <hi>to beleeve in the Lord Jeſus.</hi> So in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.3. God reprehends men that ſpend their time for that, which is worth nothing, laying out ſo much time in acting, &amp; doing, for juſtification, and ſalvation, &amp; in the mean while, neglecting the glorious and precious Goſpel of grace by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:180666:51"/>his Son. <hi>Wherefore doe yee ſpend money for that which is not bread?</hi> Wherefore doe yee ſpend the ſtrength of your bodies &amp; ſpirits in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, labouring and tyring out your dayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpirit of bondage, that yee may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and ſaved? <hi>You ſpend your money for that that is not bread;</hi> you ſhall never have a piece of bread from the Law for this; you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfie the Law, it will not give you a crumb of comfort, worke, and doe what you can. <hi>Hearken unto me, and eat that which is good, and let your ſoule delight it ſelfe in fatneſſe.</hi> Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and ignorant people, they take paines to ſatisfie their ſpirits, and to get comfort, by making long prayers, and obſerving faſting dayes, and giving almes to the poore, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to love God and Saints, that they may be ſaved; but they labour for that that will not profit, for that, that is not bread.</p>
               <p>If duties could ſatisfie, why did Chriſt die? If we could be ſaved by the Law, why was the Goſpel made knowne? Therefore he points them to the Goſpel; <hi>Heare, and your ſoule ſhall live.</hi> That is, heare the Word of Gods grace, beleeve that God will pardon your ſinnes for his Name ſake, and not for any works or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe in your ſelves. Beleeve that Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, ungodly ſinners, the worſt of ſinners, the chiefe of them: beleeve
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:180666:51"/>this, and your ſoules ſhall live. If any bid thee worke, that thou maiſt be juſtified; to get love to the brethren, to get a good conſcience to God, and men; he ſetteth you upon a labour that will not profit you. The voyce of God is, <hi>Heare, and your ſoules ſhall live;</hi> Beleeve that which is reported concerning this Chriſt, who was borne of a woman, though the eternall Son of God, and was manifeſted in the fleſh, and hath borne the ſinnes of ſinfull fleſh; and hath made an end of all iniquitie, and brought in, everlaſting righteouſneſſe. In beleeving this doctrine, we are aſſured of his love. And this God bids us preach, and nothing elſe for juſtification, ceaſing from our ſelves, our works, our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, our performances, reſting on his love, ſetting foot on his grace, diſclaiming our doings, not coming to him in the ſight of our works, and our love, but of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as it is diſplayed in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is poſitively forbidden, and God reproves men for it; he ſhews them that they undoe their ſoules to eternitie, if in a ſecret way they reſt upon their owne works. <hi>Iſrad which followed after the Law of righteouſneſſe, hath not attained to the Law of righteouſneſſe. Wherefore? Becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 9.31,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:180666:52"/>32. He doth not ſay, that they did direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek ſalvation by the Law, but indirectly, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſed tanquam operibus legis,</hi>) as it were by the works of the Law. Works are not onely not required, but forbidden. God doth not bid us to worke, but he forbids us to worke for juſtification. It is not he that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that is juſtified, but he that worketh not, but <hi>beleeveth in him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 4.5. When the Apoſtle preſſeth men to beleeve, and perſwadeth them to entertaine the doctrine of grace that he preached; in thoſe Exhortations there is a vertuall forbidding of working for life. When he bids them onely to beleeve, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.3. it is as much as if he had bid them not to work. Conſonant to that ſpeech of his; <hi>A man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 2.16. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth works, that he may eſtabliſh men in the doctrine of faith, and prohibiteth work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for juſtification.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We are not to deſire the preſence of good works that we may be juſtified. A man is not onely to goe thus farre, to be convinced that he is not juſtified by works; but he is to be convinced of this, that the preſence of good works are not needfull and neceſſary to him when he comes to God for juſtification. I am
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:180666:52"/>not onely to profeſſe, that my works have no influence into my juſtification, or are the cauſe of it, but that good works in the preſence of them, are not needfull and neceſſary to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Good works are inefficatious to juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not needfull to be preſent, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is to be juſtified. Here ſome flie off from the truth, they acknowledge that we are not juſtified by works, yet they require the preſence of good works in the perſon who is to be juſtified. But God when he efficatiouſly works upon us, convinceth us, that not onely our good works have no cauſalitie in juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but likewiſe convinceth us, that there is no neceſſitie for the preſence of good works in us before juſtification. And this is cleare, becauſe when the Spirit comes, he ſhews us that we are to come to the throne of grace, not as men already made righteous, and holy, but as men unrighteous, and unholy, to be made holy by Jeſus Chriſt. So that good works are not neceſſary as a qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or diſpoſition in the perſon to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</p>
               <p>This is that glorious Goſpel, which carnall reaſon cannot apprehend, mans learning can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach, which the worlds wiſdome accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth fooliſhneſſe, and which the Devill and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:180666:53"/>worldly men will alwayes oppoſe, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute. What ſaith the zealous Phariſee, Will the God of love juſtifie him that hates him? Will the God of juſtice ſitting upon the throne pronounce the ſinner guiltleſſe? Yea Phariſee he will. What ſaith the Scripture, <hi>He juſtifieth the ungodly.</hi> What is an ungodly man, but he that hates God, that is an enemy to God, that doth not for the preſent love God? And when a man looks to his grace, he muſt looke on himſelfe as an unrighteous, as an unholy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man; He is not bound to come as the Phariſee, but as the Publicane; He is not to come thus qualified, I love God, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, I deſire to obey God, I am thus qualified, therefore I ſhall be juſtified, and no ſinfull man, that hath not theſe qualifications to fit him for juſtification. God bids ſinners while they are in their bloud <hi>to live,</hi> Ezek. 16.6. Chriſt cometh to call ſinners to repentance, or changedneſſe of heart by the diſcoveries of grace. For God doth not command us, to come as men loving him, or loving his people, that we may be juſtified; but when we ſee our ſelves ſinners, ungodly, and the chiefe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, then he commands us to come to the throne of grace, and offers juſtification, and ſalvation to us freely without works: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:180666:53"/>acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chiefe,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) I am the firſt of ſinners; ſo it is in the Greek <hi>(Primus non tempore, ſed malignitate)</hi> The firſt not in time, but in ſin and maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This is the truth, which <hi>Paul</hi> preached, and which he accounted, not onely worthy of acceptation, but all acceptation, for the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and excellency of it. If other truths are worthy of acceptation, this is worthy of all acceptation. If a man ſeeth that he hath a heart that will not ſuffer him to love God, that he hates the people of God, yet heareth the Goſpel preached, that there is grace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſinners, to the chiefe of ſinners; if this man beleeve, if he come and truſt the grace of God, he hath as good an aſſurauce for heaven, as heaven can give, as God gives to any that he intends to ſave, and make happy with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to eternitie.</p>
               <p>By this wee ſee, that wee are not to bring good works, becauſe their preſence is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required. Though wee ſee all evill preſent with us, and all good abſent, wee may reſt upon the promiſes of grace for juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the plaine direct way to true and perfect holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Now in the next place, I ſhall give you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, to prove that wee are not juſtified
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:180666:54"/>by works that are done after converſion. This will appeare as clearly as that which I have delivered concerning the needleſneſſe of the works of the Law, for our juſtification before our juſtification.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon which I ſhall lay down is this; Thoſe things are not the cauſe of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which follow juſtification and true faith: but good works follow juſtification and true faith; therefore good works are not the cauſes of juſtification. The cauſe precedes the effect; good works are the effect of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; right reaſon therefore will teach us, that they cannot precede juſtification. The worke of the juſtification of a ſinner, is done &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, before works are done, and therefore works can have no hand in our juſtification. That old rule is as old as the doctrine of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and as true as it is old, <hi>(Bona operanon praecedunt juſtificandu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſed ſequuntur juſtificatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;)</hi> Good works doe not precede in the perſon who is to be juſtified, but follow the perſon that is juſtified. From w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it will follow, that a man is not juſtified for good works that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low faith, becauſe he is juſtified before he hath thoſe good works: good works in order of nature, following true faith; true faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. I am not to love that I may beleeve, but I muſt beleeve Gods love,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180666:54"/>that I may love God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. Wee love him, becauſe he firſt loved us. Wee are firſt purged from dead works by beleeving, and then wee ſerve the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. God hath ſworn that juſtification ſhall goe before ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.73. He firſt delivereth us from our ſinnes, our ſoules deadly enemies, and then <hi>wee ſerve him without feare in holineſſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> as <hi>Zachariah</hi> being filled with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, doth ſweetly powre forth the holy water of this ſoule-refreſhing truth. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75. Redemption doth antecede purification: He hath redeemed us from all iniquitie, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie us to himſelfe a peculiar people, zealous of good works. Faith which looketh upon the grace of him who is inviſible, is the mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, <hi>(Radix bonorum operum fides,)</hi> Faith is the roote, good works are the fruit, there muſt be the roote before the fruit.</p>
               <p>But ſome man may ſay, may wee not ſee the fruit before wee ſee the roote? as wee ſee ſome fruit upon trees, while the root lies hid; and from the beholding of the fruit, may wee not very rationally conclude, that there is a root: ſo from the beholding of our good works, the fruit of true faith, may wee not conclude, that there is faith, though it be not in it ſelfe viſible unto us.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; That this ſimilitude
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:180666:55"/>proves not the thing; for though it be a truth, that good works may appeare firſt to men, yet faith is firſt viſible to us in our own ſpirits; and it is impoſſible that I ſhould ſee the truth of good works, except I firſt ſee the truth of faith. Evident ſanctification doth evidence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the truth of our juſtification, but ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not evident, our juſtification being not evidenced to us in the firſt place. If it be manifeſted in our ſpirits to us, that our works are good, it will preſently be manifeſted unto us, that we have true faith. But this is not manifeſted in our ſpirits, that our works are truly good works, and ſuch which cannot be done by an hypocrite, untill the truth of our faith be manifeſted unto us.</p>
               <p>I will make this evident by this reaſon; A man muſt ſee his good works, as done either under the Law, or under the Goſpel, and look upon them, either in the glaſſe of the Law, or the glaſſe of the Goſpel; if a man look upon them in the glaſſe of the Law, and doe rightly and ſpiritually underſtand the Law, he ſhall be ſo farre from drawing an aſſurance of his juſtification from them, that he ſhall behold himſelf curſed and damned, with all his good works. For the Law curſeth every man that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth not in the doing of all things which are commanded by God. It is indeed a divine
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:180666:55"/>looking-glaſſe, in which things to be done, or avoyded, are diſcovered. (<hi>Lex eſt divinum ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in quo facienda &amp; fugienda refulgent,</hi> Aug.) but it will ſentence us to death for the leaſt ſpot or wrinkle which it doth diſcover; ſo that it is impoſſible, that a man ſhould ſee himſelfe juſtified in the glaſſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay, he may look upon his love, ſinceritie, and works, in the glaſſe of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And to this I anſwer, that if he look upon them in the glaſſe of the Goſpel, which is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, then he muſt put himſelfe under the Goſpel, and look upon himſelfe, as a man in Chriſt, that ſo he may ſee his works good by Jeſus Chriſt; which he will never be able to ſee without the eye of faith, which ſeeth things inviſible, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and by which wee look upon Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. dwell in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. Live in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. And doe living works, acceptable to God by the life of Chriſt in us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. <hi>By faith with open face wee behold as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, and are changed into the ſame Image, from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. and ſee that our good works are the effects of Chriſts love, diſcovered in himſelfe and in his Goſpel to our ſoules. And therefore when <hi>John</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme us, that we ſhall know that wee know
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:180666:56"/>him, if we keep his Commandement. He doth propoſe beleeving, as the firſt Commandement of God, without which we cannot aſſure our ſelves, that we are obedient to his other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his commandement, that we beleeve in him whom he hath ſent.</hi> Good works after a man hath faith, are not the cauſe of juſtification, but the conſequent; they follow a mans juſtification; they doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the act of juſtification; they neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the act of Gods grace, by which he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a ſinner, neither doe they precede juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Court of Conſcience: But being juſtified by faith, we have peace (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.) in our Conſciences. This was the doctrine which was frequently preached by thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Carpenters, which did firſt ſtrike at the hornes of the beaſt, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t dilectio oriatur, neceſſe eſt praecedere fidem hoc eſt fiducia miſericordiae</hi>) It is neceſſary, ſaith <hi>Melancthon,</hi> that faith, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is a confidence of Gods morcy, doe precede love. And in another place, <hi>(Non nititur fides noſtra dilectione, ſed tantum miſericordia promiſſa, ut conſtat, nec exiſtere dilectio poteſt niſi ſit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſa remiſſio)</hi> Faith is not grounded upon our love, but the promiſed mercy of God, ſo that it is manifeſt, that there cannot be true love, unleſſe remiſſion of ſinnes be firſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:180666:56"/>
               <p>Another reaſon is from the imperfection of workes wrought by a man after he is juſtified; If any man that is juſtified, look on his works, and doe not behold them in the glaſſe of the Goſpel, he ſhall reade his own condemnation for his works. There is an imperfection in our works, ſeeing wee doe not love God ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as we ſhould, with all our heart, all our minde, and all our ſpirit: but while the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate part, through the power of the Spirit runs after God, and loves God; the fleſhly part runneth after ſinne, and hates God. Therefore ſeeing there is ſuch imperfection in the works that we performe, that the beſt of us are unprofitable ſervants, and that the moſt holy amongſt us, doe that for which he may be damned every day, if God ſhould not deale with us in the Goſpel, but in the Law; it will follow, that a man cannot be juſtified by the works that he doth after he hath faith, and is converted, &amp; doth works which are wrought by the Spirit of grace.</p>
               <p>It may here be objected, that the good works of Saints are perfect.</p>
               <p>For an anſwer to this, I referre the Reader to what ſhall be delivered from thoſe words; <hi>That he which is borne of God ſinneth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the next Conſideration, which is this; That wee are not juſtified by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:180666:57"/>the practiſe of any Goſpel-Ordinances, which are commanded by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. There are ſome, who it may be, are convinced that they are not juſtified by works, yet I know not what new kinde of Popery they have found out; for they thinke to pleaſe God by ſubmitting to Ordinances, and finding out the true Diſcipline and government of Chriſts Church; therefore you ſhall finde a kinde of ſpirit of bondage in them, if they be not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied concerning the true diſcipline, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; Ordinances of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate this, and ſhew clearly, that as we are not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by works before, or after converſion, ſo we are not juſtified, and ſaved, by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to any Ordinance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Salvation is not in theſe, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be found in theſe availeable to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Formes of government and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, doe not make men Chriſtians, but a lively faith in the Lord Jeſus. When <hi>Caius Marius Victorinus</hi> told <hi>Simplicianus,</hi> that he was turned from Heatheniſme to Chriſtianiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and he replyed, that he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him, unleſſe he ſaw him in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Chriſtians: He wittily thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the raſhneſſe of his ſpeech, <hi>(Ergone parietes faciunt Chriſtianos?)</hi> Doe your walls
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:180666:57"/>then make Chriſtians? So to thoſe that ſay, men are of the world, until they are under this or that forme of government, and ordinance, I may thus ſpeak; do theſe things make Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? Presbytery (all government) is nothing, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency is nothing, dipping is nothing, but faith w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> worketh by love. The Apoſtle clearly proves this poynt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>I teſtifie againe to every man that is circumciſed, that he is a debtor to do the whole Law: Chriſt is become of none effect to you;</hi> he ſhall profit you nothing. Wee know that <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſed <hi>Timothy;</hi> after he was a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Goſpel, and ſubmitted himſelfe to many of the rites &amp; Ceremonies of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> ſhaved his head, &amp; put himſelfe under a Jewiſh vow, yet here he ſaith, if a man be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he is a <hi>debtor to the whole Law.</hi> His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this; that if a man ſubmit to circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as thinking it will any whit availe him to his juſtiſication, and ſalvation, that man ſhall not be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, but he is a debtor to the whole Law; he is not under grace, but under the curſe of the Law. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1. When ſome preached that there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie for men to be circumciſed, and keepe the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they might be juſtified; ſee how the doctrine was diſrelliſhed by the Apoſtles; <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it a tempting of God, and laying a yoke upon the necks of the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:180666:58"/>which they nor their fathers were able to beare. <hi>Paul,</hi> though as a ſpiritual man, he could become all things to all men, to the Jew, as a Jew, to the Gentile as a Gentile, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.20, 21, 22. That by all means he might ſave ſome, yet how doth he thunder and lighten in the face of thoſe that laid too much upon the practiſe of outward things, denying unto them any ſalvation by Chriſt. And as he ſaid, <hi>If yee be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing;</hi> ſo if any man be baptized, I may ſay, Chriſt ſhall profit him nothing. If any man to ſatisfie his conſcience, deſire one to dip him, or joyne himſelfe as a member to any Congregation, thinking by pleaſing God, and Chriſt, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ſalvation in this way, he is a ſtranger to Chriſt, and unacquainted with his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Faith is inconſiſtent with any thing in this ſenſe; faith will not ſuffer any thing to be joyned with it in point of juſtification; and if we will joyne any thing with faith for juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that faith is nothing worth at all. If we will doe one thing that wee may be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wee muſt doe every thing. If thou wilt be a member of a Church, as they ſpeake, that thou maiſt be comforted, juſtified, and ſaved, thou art bound to fulfill the whole Law.</p>
               <p>The Law is well compared by one to a chaine, which is linked together, and if we take
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:180666:58"/>one linck of it, the weight of the whole chaine will be upon us: So, if wee doe any thing that wee may be juſtified, wee lay our ſelves under all the bondage and ſlavery of the Law, and are tyed to doe every thing in the Law, that wee may be juſtified. He that is circumciſed, is a debtor to doe the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>But in Chriſt Jeſus, neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith which worketh by love,</hi> ver. 6. By <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> he means all the outward priviledges of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> theſe doe nothing availe to ſalvation; and by <hi>uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumeiſion,</hi> the priviledges of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and the Supper. All outward priviledges and prerogatives, doe nothing availe to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The kingdome of Heaven is not in theſe things, not <hi>circumciſion,</hi> or <hi>uncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or any outward Ordinances. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven is within you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another reaſon may be drawn from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the nature of Ordinances, &amp; our ſubmitting our ſelves to them. There is not ſo much in that outward obedience that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to outward Ordinances, as in that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is given to the morall precepts of the Law, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.19. Our Saviour commends the Young man for acknowledging that obedience to God, <hi>loving God and his neighbour,</hi> were more then all burnt Offerings and Sacrifice; <hi>There is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:180666:59"/>more in internall obedience, then in obedience to externall Ordinances.</hi> From which Concluſion thus I argue; If thoſe things that are of a more excellent nature, as, love to God, and love to our neighbour, and relieving the poore, be altogether unprofitable, ineffica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and unavaileable to juſtification, and ſalvation; then theſe outward works of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, in ſubmitting to outward Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are much leſſe availeable. This is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>à majore ad minus,</hi> from the greater to the leſſe. If the greateſt works advantage nothing for juſtification, and ſalvation, then certainly the doing of inferiour works, the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a man to dip mee, and to make mee a member of his Church, cannot advantage me: Theſe things are works in their own nature farre inferiour to the great works of the Law, love to God, and to the people of God, and to the poore Saints of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Therefore if theſe works be altogether una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileable, if they can nothing further my juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; nay, if they hinder mee in point of juſtification, if May any weight upon them; then certainly theſe inferiour works can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further my juſtification, and ſalvation. And if a man doe not practiſe them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Command of Chriſt, through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, it is no way prejudiciall to his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:180666:59"/>and ſalvation. It did not prejudice the thiefe that he dyed without Baptiſme, that he did not receive the Supper of the Lord, that he was not admitted a member of a viſible Church; it did not prejudice him that he had no fellowſhip with the Saints. A man may be juſtified and faved, not onely without the works of the Law, and works after converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he may be ſaved, though he doe not ſubmit himſelfe to the practiſe of outward Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Therefore if any ſay unto you, you muſt be baptized, or you cannot be ſaved, I cannot look on you as a Saint, except you be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, you muſt be members of a Church, or elſe you cannot be members of Chriſt, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not acknowledge you as a brother, rather pity their ignorance, then yeeld to their exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. What a ſad thing is it for men to place Saintſhip and Religion in theſe things, when the Scripture plainly and punctually in this reſpect overthroweth them? <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. <hi>The Kingdome of God is not in meats and drinks,</hi> (concerning which there were many contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies and janglings in thoſe times) <hi>but in righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since the Scripture requires nothing to make a man an heire with Chriſt, but faith.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:180666:60"/>What abominable Popery is it to ſay, that a man cannot be a Saint, if he doe not ſubmit to outward Ordinances.</p>
               <p>I cannot but commend what I finde in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> who was zealouſly carried forth againſt ſome in his time, that made a rent from him in a Legall way, becauſe they differed from him about externall things and Ordinances, which are no juſt ground why Saints ſhould divide themſelves from one another; who ſaith, <hi>That they had brought in another kinde of Popery, and more dangerous then that which he bad overthrowne by his preaching; for as for groſſe Popery,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>mens eyes begin to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, to ſee the abſurdities of it. But theſe men come in a ſubtle way, and pretending a neceſſitie of ſubmitting to formes, inſtitutions, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, doe pervert the pure and ſimple Goſpel of Chriſt, labouring to perſwade men, that if they doe not ſubmit to the Ordinances of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, he would not acknowledge, and confeſſe them before his Father, and that unleſſe they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his government, they ſhould not be under him for juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore wee are to be rightly informed concerning theſe things, and if wee doe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to outward Ordinances, wee ſhould not doe it from legall principles, for it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not to practiſe them, then to practiſe them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:180666:60"/>from theſe principles, to the ruining of our ſoules. And they that draw Diſciples after them by ſuch rigid and Goſpel deſtroying principles, will finde, to their ſhame, that thoſe that they have brought in by theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, will fall away from them to their ſhame and infamy; For God is diſhonoured, Chriſt is robbed of his Grace, and the free Spirit looſeth his glory.</p>
               <p>Suffer mee now to make a little uſe, and ſo I ſhall commend you, and what hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the bleſſing of God.</p>
               <p>You have ſeene that wee are ſaved by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Goſpel, without any works going before juſtification, or any ſubmiſſion to the Ordinances of the Goſpel, which may follow it. This doth bring foure ſorts of people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a juſt reproofe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Such as are groſsly Popiſh, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtification by their own works and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, or affirming that a man is not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith onely, but by faith and works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Theſe deny juſtification by the Grace of God, and the righteouſneſſe of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt through faith, and ſet up a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by inherent righteouſneſſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, holding that wee are then juſtified from ſinne, when it is removed out of our ſight, ſence, feeling, lives, ſpirits and converſations.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:180666:61"/>
               <p>The ſtrongeſt Argument, which they bring for the confirming of their aſſertion, and in which they doe moſt triumph, as though they had obtained a victory over the truth of Gods Grace; is in the 2 <hi>Jam.</hi> 24. <hi>Yee ſee then bow that by works a man is juſtified, and not by faith onely.</hi> Doth not <hi>James,</hi> ſay they, lay down our aſſertion in ſo many words, joyning faith and good workes as con-cauſes of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Some to eſcape the edge of this Argument have denied this Epiſtle to be Canonicall, like him who being unable to unty the <hi>Gordian knott,</hi> did cut it in pieces. Thus <hi>Lucius Oſian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> propoſing this objection of his Antagoniſts doth thinke that he hath for ever cut it to pieces by their anſwer.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, others, yea moſt of thoſe, whom wee call <hi>Proteſtant</hi> writers, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of <hi>James</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> and his fellow-Apoſtles, with one conſent give in, this anſwer to this objection; <hi>diſtinguiſhing of a twofold juſtification: Firſt, a juſtification before God; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a juſtification before men.</hi> Paul, <hi>as they apprehend, doth ſpeake of the former of theſe,</hi> James <hi>of the latter; ſuppoſing this to be the genuine ſence and meaning of</hi> James, <hi>that wee are juſtified by works, that is, declaratively before men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But with reſpect and due reverence to the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:180666:61"/>piety and learning of theſe men who give in this anſwer, give me leave, <hi>being not ſworn</hi> (in verba magiſtri) <hi>or obliged to juſtifie what any man, or many men, though godly and learned, have apprehended to be the meaning of a place,</hi> to ſhew my reaſons, why I diſſent from them; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to give in mine own anſwer to the place.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I apprehend that <hi>James</hi> doth not ſpeake of a juſtification before men, becauſe his proofe is from <hi>Abrahams</hi> being juſtified by works, when he offered up his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as it is evident by the preceding words; which acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Abrahams</hi> would not have juſtified him before men. They would have looked upon him rather as a cruell malefactor, then a Saint in offering up his onely Sonne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This buſineſſe was ſo tranſacted between <hi>God and Abraham,</hi> that it was not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to men, that they ſhould juſtifie him for it; When he went to performe this act of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his God, he left his ſervants behind him, and carried no man with him, but his Sonne who was to be ſacrificed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If wee view the place, <hi>Ger.</hi> 22.11, 12. out of which <hi>James</hi> doth prove his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will be evident, that it proveth not a juſtification towards men, but towards God. <hi>And the Angel ſaid, Lay not thy hand upon the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:180666:62"/>Lad, for now I know that thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not withheld thy ſonne, thine onely ſonne from mee.</hi> This Angel was Chriſt, as it doth appeare by his calling of himſelfe God; and he is juſtified by him, as a man that feared him. And in the 16, 17, and 18. verſes; <hi>By my ſelfe have I ſworn, ſaith the Lord, becauſe thou haſt done this thing, that in bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, and in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> It is cleare by this, that the juſtiſication ſpoken of, is not a juſtification before men, but before God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I ſhall therefore give in what I doe conceive to be the meaning of the holy Spirit in theſe words: <hi>James</hi> doth not ſpeake of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as it is taken properly, and uſed by <hi>Paul,</hi> but doth ſpeake of juſtification as it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken improperly. He ſpeaketh not of it as an act by which wee are reconciled, and our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities pardoned, but he ſpeaketh of it as an act by which God doth approve a man to be juſtified by his works which he doth after his juſtification. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a juſtified man by faith, before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne; now God doth beare witneſſe to the works and fruits of his faith, and doth juſtifie him by his works in this ſence, that is, he doth approve him, to be a man that feareth and loveth him. And this is the Anſwer which is given by the learned <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:180666:62"/>[Non intelligatur verbum juſtificari pro reconciliari, ſed ut alias ſaepe dicitur, pro ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probari. Juſtificatur homo ex operibus: id eſt; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens juſtitiam operum, approbatur, placet Deo] The word juſtification is not to be taken for reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but approbation: man is juſtified by his works, that is, having a righteouſneſſe of works</hi> (or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification) <hi>God doth approve him, his works doe pleaſe God.</hi> And as when wee ſee good fruit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a tree, we uſe to ſay, this is a good tree. Not that the good fruit doth make the tree good, but the tree being good doth bring forth the good fruit: So God, having made us good trees by juſtifying of us by his Grace, doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to bring forth good fruit, and ſpeaking (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) after the manner of men to us men, doth approve us to be good trees, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth good fruit. And thus much for the reproofe of theſe men, and in anſwer to their objection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This doth ſerve to diſcover and reprove ſuch, who would ſeeme to be no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who yet in a more refined and ſubtle way, do preach forth the ſame doctrine which the others doe maintaine, and preferre ſome Popiſh bookes, which are wrought with a fine and curious thread, before any bookes which have been publiſhed, by any who have been eminent for the knowledge of Gods Grace in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:180666:63"/>Chriſt through faith for juſtification. Theſe are they <hi>who, if it were poſſible, would deceive the very Elect;</hi> laying ſiege againſt the Goſpel, and the doctrine of juſtification, while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they are fighters for it. And theſe preach that wee are not to locke ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Chriſt without us for juſtification, as a Chriſt within us. And that we are not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Chriſt that is in heaven, but by Chriſt within us; which Chriſt of theirs is nothing elſe, when yee are well acquainted with him, but the workings of their own ſpirits in zeale and love to God, and when they have high thoughts of God, their will is conformable to the will of God, and they thinke the ſame things that God thinkes, and ſubmit to God in their wayes. They looke upon theſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as their perfection and juſtification; and this is Chriſt within them. Such kinde of Doctrines as this is, are the firſt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and principles by which the Politique and Civilized Familiſts doe leaven their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pills, leading them from the plaine and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doctrine of the Goſpel. The ſpirit of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and deluſion which was in <hi>H. N. (the firſt father of the Familiſts, which have lived of late, or are yet living)</hi> did worke mightily in him to pervert the Goſpel, and to bring in Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſme in this way of flaming zeale, love, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:180666:63"/>holineſſe. And if he were now alive, he would wonder at his numerous off-ſpring, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny, which he hath now amongſt us. But that you may avoid this firſt rock, before yee be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulfed into the deepe and bottomleſſe pit of Familiſticall Atheiſme, and Antichriſtianiſme, let what hath been ſpoken to reprove them, eſtabliſh you in the truth of the Goſpel, and looke upon the beſt piece of Familiſme but as upon refined Popery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For wee are not ſaved by Chriſt working in us, and making us obedient to his Fathers holy will: but wee are ſaved by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, who hath ſhed his bloud for us.</hi> And though we deny not, but that wee have Chriſt within us, and the Spirit of Grace to ſubdue our ſinnes. <hi>Yet this is denied, that the workings of the Spirit are our juſtification; for wee are juſtified before wee have theſe workings: which wee feele within us.</hi> Wee are not juſtified becauſe we love God and Chriſt, and deſire to walke in ſinceritie to glorifie God: <hi>but becauſe wee apprehend the Grace of God in Chriſt; and therefore we love God and Chriſt, and deſire in ſincerity, to walke in all the wayes that God hath made knowne to us in Chriſt.</hi> Wee are not juſtified by the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our will to Gods will, or the oneneſſe of our will with his; <hi>but wee are juſtified by faith, before any of thoſe works are wrought in our hearts by the Spirit of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:180666:64"/>
               <p>He that denies this is ignorant of Chriſt and the Goſpel, and is not an honourer of Chriſt, but a Miniſter of Satan and Antichriſt, and a deluder of the people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This is for the reproofe of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall Proteſtant, who profeſſeth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of juſtification by faith without works with his tongue, but denieth it with his heart; not daring to truſt his ſoule in the armes of a Saviour, unleſſe he brings good works along with him to procure his welcome and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
               <p>This man ſtumbles at the threſh-hold of the doore of Grace, being never able to enter into the houſe of love; becauſe he will not adventure his ſalvation upon the promiſes of Grace which are made to ſinners, that have no workes, or righteouſneſſe inherently in themſelves. He will not goe to God, or cloſe with a promiſe of Grace, unleſſe he have the ſight of righteouſneſſe in himſelfe in the firſt place. He will tell you, that good works are not the matter of our juſtification, and yet he will not conclude that he is a juſtified man, untill he ſee good works in himſelfe. This man <hi>following the law of righteouſneſſe, doth not attaine to the law of righteouſneſſe,</hi> becauſe he ſeeketh it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:180666:64"/>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaks againſt this phariſaicall opinion, when he ſaith, <hi>Wee are juſtified by Grace through beleeving;</hi> not through working. I am not bound to love God, and the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that I may be beloved of God: but I muſt beleeve, that I may love God, and my brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The prepoſterous preaching of ſanctification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtification for the evidencing of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is that which keepeth many poore creatures in bondage for many yeares, and ruines many ſoules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How many are gone to Hell, who thought they were going to Heaven? deceiving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with falſe and unſound aſſurances. And fetching their comforts from the ſight of their own works, and not from the Grace of God in Chriſt, by a pure act of beleeving. If this were the right path to juſtification, we ſhould not be juſtified in beleeving, but in loving, and working. For I ſeeing my love to God, ſhould conclude Gods love to me; <hi>But, herein is love, not that wee loved God, but that God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and ſent his Sonne to be the propitiation for our ſinnes,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.10. <hi>And true love is wrought in us by the ſight of Gods free love to us, in an act of beleeving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore if thou haſt no aſſurance of the love of God, but that which thou haſt gotten from the ſight of thine own works, and from
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:180666:65"/>the concluſions of thine own baſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart; as the ordinary way of ſome hath been, thou haſt no aſſurance at all.</p>
               <p>When thou ſhalt lie under a great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou wilt finde no comfort in this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: And thou ſhalt finde at the great day, <hi>when thou ſhalt appeare before God and Chriſt,</hi> that this aſſurance will not be worth a Ruſh.</p>
               <p>This building upon thy love to God, and not upon Gods free love to thee, is to build upon a ſandy foundation; and not upon Chriſt by faith. And if the Lord convince thee of thy folly, thou wilt lay a better foundation of joy and comfort then this can be unto thee. <hi>For other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.</p>
               <p>Though a ſpirituall man can make a good uſe of marks and ſignes, as of love to God and Saints, when he ſeeth them in the light of the Spirit, as fruits proceeding from faith, as the roote; yet by drawing a concluſion from the ſight of ſuch things, which we apprehend to be in our ſelves, of our happineſſe and good eſtate before God, wee ſhall not ſo truely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as certainly deceive our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This is for the reprehenſion, of blind, &amp; ignorant Formaliſts, who place Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion rather in conformity to outward formes of Government, and ſubmiſſion to externall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:180666:65"/>Ordinances, then in the faith of the Goſpel, which is operative by love. Juſtification doth not lye in our obedience to the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, but in Jeſus Chriſt. Wee are not made Saints, by being made members of any Church or Congregation, but by faith in the head of the Church. Woe to him that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his obedience and ſubmiſſion to any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance the ground of his comfort, as too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny zealous Formaliſts do, who run from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to Congregation, from one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to another, to get ſolid comfort to their ſoules, apprehending that they are undone creatures, and cannot be true Saints, unleſſe they be under the true practiſe of all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: whereas it is a plaine truth, revealed in the Goſpel of truth, that neither ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to an Ordinance can make a true Saint, nor the want of Ordinances un-ſaint any man that is made one with Chriſt in beleeving. <hi>He is not a Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that Circumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh. But he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is that of the heart, in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God,</hi> Rom. 2.28, 29. So he is a true Saint, who is not a viſible member of a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but <hi>he whoſe life of faith is hidden in Jeſus Chriſt. He is baptized, not whoſe body is waſhed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:180666:66"/>with water; but, whoſe ſoule is waſhed in the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21. He is a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant, and breaks bread, who doth not breake bread outwardly, but by faith doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly feed upon the bread of life. Wee are not juſtified by works of the Law done before or after juſtification, nor by yeelding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any command concerning outward Ordinances, but by our ſubmitting in our Judgements to the truth of Gods Grace in Jeſus Chriſt for juſtification without theſe.</p>
               <p>I would not here be miſtaken, as though I did ſpeake againſt any Saints, or any who are ſpirituall and faithfull in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any externall Ordinances; But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt zealous Formaliſts, who doe make Saintſhip and fellowſhip to depend upon theſe things, and are not ſpiritually acquainted with the truth of Gods Grace, but are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>In the next place, here lyeth Conſolation for all that heare me this day, in that which I have delivered, if God ſhall give unto them beleeving hearts.</p>
               <p>Haſt thou never done any good worke? haſt thou hated the wayes of God, and his people? haſt thou never looked after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, government, and ordinances of Chriſt? Yet here is a ground for thee to come in unto
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:180666:66"/>Chriſt: we are juſtified by grace through belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, not through working. Therefore let it be ſuppoſed, that thou art without works, yet thou haſt good ground to take comfort in that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hath bin delivered; believe and thou art in a happy condition, though thou haſt never done a good worke. Thou art not to come to Jeſus Chriſt as a righteous man: But thou are to come unto him, that thou maiſt be made a righteous man. If thou ſeeſt thy ſelfe a vile ſinner, caſt thy ſelfe into the armes of the grace of the Father by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and thou ſhalt be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him</hi> 2 Cor. 5.</p>
               <p>Promiſes of Grace are left by God upon record in the Scripture of truth for ſinners, for ignorant ſinners Iſa. 29.24. <hi>They that erred in Spirit ſhall come to underſtanding;</hi> For ſinners that murmure againſt him, his wayes, truths, &amp; Prophets, as it followeth in the ſame verſe. <hi>They that murmured ſhall learne Doctrine.</hi> For backſliding ſinners Hoſea 14.4. <hi>I will heale their back flidings, I will love them freely. Him that cometh unto him he will in nowiſe caſt out</hi>

                  </gap>. Here are two Negatives in the Greeke, which doe ſtrengthen the Negation. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.37. By which ſpeech our Saviour doth aſſure poore ſinfull creatures, that if in truth they come unto him, they ſhall not be rejected
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:180666:67"/>by him; or ejected from the armes of his love and mercy.</p>
               <p>Chriſt's invitation is to all ſinners, All that will, may lay hold of him, not only the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but the unrighteous. If thou canſt not love God, thou maiſt looke on the Grace of God, and take comfort that God loves thee, Chriſt came not to call the righteous, but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the cheifeſt and vileſt of ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Therefore come as a ſinner, as the cheifeſt of ſinners, come I ſay, and welcome. The Lord Jeſus keeps open-houſe for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, the blinde, the lame, ſhall not finde the doores ſhut upon them. They ſhall be well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as ſinners, that cannot be entertained as Saints.</p>
               <p>It is reported of <hi>Romes</hi> firſt Founder, that wanting Subjects, he ſent forth ſome, to make known his will to all people, who lived about him, that if any malefactors, or ſuch who were oppreſſed in the places where they lived, did come in unto him, they ſhould live peaceably in his Kingdome, and he would protect them againſt any that ſhould purſue them, and by this meanes he became ſuddenly the King of a numerous people. So Chriſt doth ſend forth his Proclamations to aſſure ſinners, and vile malefactors, that if they will come under his Scepter, they ſhall live peaceably under his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:180666:67"/>Government, and that hee will ſafe-guard them from all their enemies, which ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them, and by this meanes his dominions are enlarged from Sea, to Sea, and ſinners doe rejoyce in the King of Sion. This doctrine if it were received, would anſwer all the objections which are raiſed in the hearts of men, againſt their happineſſe by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Is there any ſad, comfortleſſe ſoule, which would not be comforted if this truth were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? What canſt thou object againſt thy ſelfe to bereave thy ſelfe of peace, which would not be removed if this were throughly believed. Art thou a ſinner? Chriſt offereth himſelfe to ſinners. Art thou an old ſinner? An old ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is but a ſinner. Haſt thou bin a <hi>Phariſee</hi> like <hi>Paul,</hi> perſecuting Chriſt and the doctrine of Grace? A perſecuting <hi>Phariſee</hi> is but a ſinner. And <hi>Paul</hi> was received to mercy, that ſuch might not be without hope of mercy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. Art thou an Hypocrite? An Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may come as a ſinner to Chriſt. Bring what objection thou canſt, and a perſwaſion concerning the truth of Gods grace ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it, and if thou doeſt believe, thou haſt as good an aſſurance as any is in Heaven, &amp; which will hold good, when the hope of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite will come to nothing.</p>
               <p>Let no objection keepe thee from comfort,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:180666:68"/>but believe what thou haſt heard: if thou art a ſinner conclude not, that Chriſt belongs not to thee, becauſe thou art a ſinner: but ſay, I am a ſinner, therfore Chriſt belongs to me, Chriſt came to ſave ſinners.</p>
               <p>As the bright beames of the Sun diſpell all miſts, and clouds: ſo the truth of this doctrine, if thou underſtand it in the light of the Spirit, will diſpell all thy doubts and objections of unbeliefe. They will vaniſh, and thou that cameſt hether under a ſpirit of bondage, ſhalt goe away with a ſpirit of adoption, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The true Goſpel believed will quickly bring true comfort to thy ſoule. If any of you want comfort and aſſurance, it is becauſe you believe not. Chriſt doth knock at the doore of our hearts, and if by believing the doore be opened, He will feaſt with us. It is unbeliefe which doth bolt the doore, doth keepe him out, and doth keepe joy from us. The gates of Heaven are ſhut upon workers, and open to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: ſhut to thoſe who come with money in their hands; but open to thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to enter without paying any thing for their entrance: <hi>The gift of God is eternall life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will, may drinke of the waters of life freely, <hi>Rev</hi> 22.21. But if wee will not drinke without money, wee ſhall not drinke one drop
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:180666:68"/>of the water of life. We ſee that at a play-houſe they will not open the doore and let people in without they give mony. But it were a diſgrace for a King, if none ſhould ſee his Pallace but ſuch who would give money. If wee thinke to enter into heaven by doing good workes, that wee may be ſaved by what we doe, wee make heaven like a play-houſe: but if wee looke on heaven as the Pallace of the great King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, let us know that wee may enter without money. It were a diſgrace to the King of heaven if he ſhould ſuffer none to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his doores, to come into his Pallace, but thoſe that would give ſomething to come into it: if wee have nothing to give for heaven, wee have as much as God demands, if wee doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, wee doe as much as God requires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Manifeſtè beati ſunt quibus ſine labore, vel opere aliquo remittuntur iniquitates, et peccata teguntur. Nulla ab his requiruntur paenitentiae opera, niſi tantum ut credant, Ambroſe)</hi> It is plaine that they are bleſſed, unto whom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any labour or paines, ſinnes are remitted, and iniquities covered. No workes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are required of theſe, this is onely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, that they doe believe. For he that worketh not, but beliveth in him that juſtifieth the ungodly, <hi>his faith is counted for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> Rom. 4.5. So much for this time.</p>

               <p>By grace, in this place wee are to underſtand the free favour of God to his poore undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures. That which is tranſlated grace
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:180666:69"/>here, in other places is tranſlated ravour; So it is ſaid that our bleſſed Lord and Saviour <hi>increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in wiſdome, and ſtature.</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>and in favour with God and men,</hi> Luke 2. <hi>ult.</hi> So it is ſaid that <hi>Joſeph found favour in the ſight of Pharaoh King of Egypt,</hi> Act. 7.10. And it is ſaid that <hi>David found favour before God, ver.</hi> 46. The grace of God is the ſame with his favour, This grace, or free favour of God to poore creatures, is held forth to us in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as it is in God; and ſo it is ſet forth to us, as that grace, and favour of his which is as eternall, as himſelfe. And in this reſpect we are ſaid to be ſaved from eternitie, in this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall grace, and favour of his as the Apoſtle ſets it forth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. where he ſaith that <hi>wee are ſaved not according to our works; but according to his owne purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began.</hi> This grace is the primary cauſe of our juſtification. God juſtifies, and ſaves none in time; but thoſe who were juſtified and ſaved before him from eternity. It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that hee was the <hi>Father of many Nations,</hi> Rom. 4.17. He was not then the father of many nations, if we look upon his progenie, &amp; poſteritie: for he had not a grand-child then: but he was the <hi>Father of many Nations before him whom he believed, even God that quickenth the dead, and calleth things
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:180666:70"/>that are not as if they were.</hi> So wee were ſaved before God in the eternall grace of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had a being among the creatures. In the ſame ſenſe that God is ſaid to determine the times, and the bounds of all mens habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from eternity, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26. So wee are ſaid to be ſaved by the grace of God. Becauſe God from eternity loved us in Chriſt, and ſaw us in his own eternall grace and favour. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wee ſhould make God like unto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſeeth things when they are done, and are viſible among the creatures: but God hee foreſaw things from eternity: He ſpeakes of things as being, when indeed they have not a being among the creatures, but have a being in his owne eye. And ſo wee had a being in the grace of God, and in the eye, and ſight of God, before wee had a being in our ſelves, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the creatures.</p>
               <p>And we are in this grace of God from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not for any works that God foreſaw would be done by us: God did not love us from eternity becauſe he foreſaw, that wee would be induſtrious, painfull, and zealous to glorify his name. There was nothing at all in the eye of God from eternity that moved God to ſet his grace, and favour upon us but his grace. It is contrary to truth which is affirmed by ſome, that God foreſeeing that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:180666:70"/>ſome men would be induſtrious, painefull, doe good workes, and live holily and righteouſly, did therefore make choice of them, and ſet his grace on them. And that foreſeeing, the idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſloath, prophaneneſſe, ungodlineſſe and impenitencie of others, he rejected them. God, as hee loves us in his grace from eternity: ſo this grace was placed upon us without any foreſight or previſion of our own workes. The Apoſtle doth clear this plainly to us in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned place, where he ſaith, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our workes, but according to his owne purpoſe and grace; intimating thus much to us, that it was onely the eternall grace of God, which moved God to be good and gracious to us in Chriſt. And ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, Tit. 3.5. <hi>Not by workes of righteouſneſſe which wee have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us;</hi> that is, according to his eternall mercy, and grace, he ſhewed favour and compaſſion to us, and pardoned our ſins. And the expreſſion of the Apoſtle is worth obſerving, <hi>Epeſ.</hi> 1.4. where ſpeaking of the eternall grace of God, hee ſaith, <hi>That God placed his grace upon us that wee ſhould be holy, and without blame before him, in love.</hi> He doth not ſay that God elected us, becauſe wee would be holy, and without blame; but <hi>He elected us that wee might be holy, and without blame before him in love:</hi> good
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:180666:71"/>workes are not the cauſe but the conſequents of Grace.</p>
               <p>Nay, I add more, that as God did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee our good workes; ſo, not our faith nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: faith is not the cauſe of grace, but grace is the cauſe of faith. God therefore enables us to believe in time, becauſe God loved us from eternity.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaking of them of <hi>Achaia</hi> ſaith, that they <hi>believed through grace,</hi> and <hi>Apollos helped them much that believed through grace</hi> Acts 18.27. It is by grace that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, it is not by faith that we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Grace.</p>
               <p>Thus we are ſaved by grace in the purpoſe of God, from eternity in the eye and ſight of God, who ſeeth all things abſent as if they were preſent, and ſpeakes of things before they are done, as if they were done.</p>
               <p>In the next place, grace in Scripture is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidered, not onely as it is in God, and as it is as eternall as God himſelfe; but the Scripture ſpeaks of the grace of God, as it is manifeſted forth to us in Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo wee are ſaved by Grace; God diſcovering his grace to us in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt. So the Apoſtle ſpeaking of grace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. ſaith: <hi>But now is manifeſted to us by the appearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath aboliſhed death,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:180666:71"/>and hath brought life, and immortality to light through the Goſpel.</hi> Hee ſpeakes firſt of grace, as it is in God, and as it is as eternall, as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: then he ſpeakes of eternall grace, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to us in the Goſpel of his deare Sonne. It is by the preaching of the Goſpel that the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall grace of the Father, in the Sonne, is made known to us.</p>
               <p>And this grace is called ſometimes the <hi>Grace of God the Father,</hi> Rom. 1.7. Sometimes it is called <hi>the grace of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>the grace of them both:</hi> becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is God, one God, in one divine eſſence with his Father.</p>
               <p>And as God in his grace is ſaid to forgive ſinnes, <hi>Mica.</hi> 7. <hi>who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth ſin?</hi> ſaith the Prophet. So Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to forgive ſinnes: the Apoſtle bids us to <hi>forgive one another, as Chriſt hath forgiven us,</hi> Col. 3.13. As there is grace in the Father to forgive ſinnes; ſo there is the ſame grace in the Sonne. The Apoſtles <hi>doubted not but that they ſhould be ſaved by the grace of Chriſt, as well as thoſe that were circumciſed,</hi> Act. 15.7. And by this grace we are ſaved. God diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now his grace to us in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, the eternall Sonne of the eternall Father.</p>
               <p>This grace in Scripture is made known to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:180666:72"/>us, as the ſole cauſe of our juſtification and ſalvation. Grace is ſo held forth for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all things, beſides grace are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Wee are juſtified by grace, <hi>excluſively;</hi> all other things being ſhut out. When God juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a man, he eyes that man, onely in his owne grace: and when God juſtifieth a man in the Court of his owne Conſcience, he ſtrips him of all his own workes, of his owne love to him, and to the brethren, and gives him onely a ſight of owne grace.</p>
               <p>This grace doth exclude all merit: if there were any merit in the creature, man could not be ſaved by Grace; the Apoſtle cleares it to us by that paſſage <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. <hi>To him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</hi> If a man could worke, or merit any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his juſtification, and ſalvation, <hi>then it were not of grace,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: <hi>the reward is not of grace, but of debt.</hi> If a man worke, then he expects wages as due to him, he may by right, and juſtice clayme what he deſerves: ſo if wee did worke for ſalvation wee might require God to beſtow, and give us what wee had wrought for. But true grace ſhuts out all merit, and workes in the creature: if we could bring any merit of the creature to joyne with his grace, <hi>grace ſhould be no more grace,</hi> as the Apoſtle, Rom. 11.6.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:180666:72"/>
               <p>If wee looke upon Grace as it is in God; ſo, before God wee were ſaved in his eternall thoughts; he in his own purpoſe and Grace, having elected us to juſtification, and eternall ſalvation in Glory by his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt. Yet he never holds forth his Grace to us; but in the countenance of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt; in whom the glory of his juſtice ſhines bright, with the glory of his grace. He ſhewes us that he hath laid all our ſins on his Sonne: that his juſtice hath received full ſatisfaction from the ſufferings of his Sonne for all our ſinnes, and ſo comes to diſcover his grace to us in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Thus Chriſt, and the Apoſtles conſtantly in their preaching, diſcovered the grace of the Father in the Son. As our Saviour to <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus: God ſo loved the world, that he gave his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Sonne, that whoſoever beleeveth on him ſhould not periſh,</hi> Joh. 3. And the Apoſtle to his <hi>Corinthians; God was in Chriſt, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world to himſelfe,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.</p>
               <p>God doth not make knowne his love for the forgiveneſſe of ſinne, but by Jeſus Chriſt. I confeſſe that wee are ſaved by grace in reſpect of God, before wee know the Grace of God in Jeius Chriſt. But wee cannot ſee this grace, untill wee behold it in the face of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Wee behold the love of God in giving the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:180666:73"/>Lord Jeſus to be the atonement, ſacrifice, and propitiation for our ſins, before wee can read the everlaſting love and favour of the Father to us in his Sonne. Eternall love is the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cauſe of our ſalvation and juſtification; but it cannot be apprehended by us, untill we apprehend, in the firſt place our Redemption in Jeſus Chriſt. And when Chriſt is embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as a Saviour in the Armes of Faith, wee riſe higher in our thoughts, by the power of the Spirit, and are brought to look upon the eternity of love. And have liberty to read eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry line in his eternall volume, which doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our eternall life and ſalvation: and are fully confirmed in the point of Gods eternall election, without the previſion of good works, which ſhould be wrought by the Creature. As the Apoſtle doth prove at large in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the <hi>Romans:</hi> And if any man will diſpute or rather cavill againſt this truth: I ſhall ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20. <hi>O man! who art thou that repliest againſt God: who hath mercy on whom be will have mercy, and whom he will he harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> And though men, unacquainted with this truth, may account this rather a ſhift or evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then an anſwer to their carnall objections againſt election, and reprobation, yet I ſhall not be aſhamed of my anſwer. It is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Speech of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (Chriſts great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:180666:73"/>againſt Antigratians in his time) <hi>Abſit ut pudeat nos hoc reſpondere, quod reſpondiſſe vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Apoſtolum.</hi> Far be it from us to be aſhamed to give the ſame anſwer, which was given by the Apoſtle: <hi>Who art thou that replieſt againſt God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the next place wee are to conſider, that in Scripture, ſalvation is taken either nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively or affirmatively.</p>
               <p>And take ſalvation in either of theſe accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And it will be evident, that wee are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by grace.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, if we take ſalvation nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; as it is a deliverance or freedome from all evill; and in this ſence wee are freed from evill, onely by grace. It is a true rule: <hi>Gratiam Chriſti nihil praecedit humani:</hi> Nothing in man doth precede, or prevent the Grace of God. The light and beames of Grace, do diſpell the clouds of our ſins. Not for our ſakes, but for his Name ſake, he covereth our ſins. It is Gods prerogative to free us from ſin by Grace, and to remove them far from us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.12. <hi>As far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo far he removed our tranſgreſſions from us.</hi> He onely can remove ſin againſt whom it is committed. He onely can caſt ſin into the depths of the Sea, who hath an Ocean of Grace in himſelfe, in which he ſwalloweth them up. <hi>Micah</hi> is ſpiritually
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:180666:74"/>tranſported beyond himſelfe, in admiring this incommunicable prerogative of the God of Grace. <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity,</hi> &amp;c? And who can think that he will part with this priviledge, which is his delight? For ſo it followeth in the ſame verſe: <hi>He retaineth not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, If wee take ſalvation affirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the inſtating of men into a condition and enjoyment of all happineſs, and felicity, ſo wee are ſaved by grace. Wee are made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, brought from a curſed condition, into a bliſsfull condition, from horror to joy, from hell to heaven, from the ſtate of nature, to the ſtate of Glory, onely by the grace of God. It is onely by Grace that wee are what wee are. By Grace our ſins are pardoned: by Grace wee have an inheritance with the Saints: by Grace wee are the high born ſonnes of the great King of heaven and earth: by Grace wee are bleſſed and loaded with all ſpirituall and temporall bleſſings in Jeſus Chriſt, and are brought to the enjoyment of eternall felicity, happineſſe, and bliſsfulneſſe. Thus wee are ſaved by grace, and by grace alone.</p>
               <p>One of the Ancients doth ſpeake excellently to this purpoſe; <hi>(Nemo ſe palpet, de ſuo Satanas eſt, de deo beatus eſt, quid eſt enim de ſuo niſi pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:180666:74"/>ſuum?)</hi> Let no man boaſt of himſelfe, for of a mans ſelfe he is a Devill; by God a man is made happy. What is a man of himſelfe, but ſin? Yee are ſaved by grace.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſalvation in Scripture is taken for ſalvation before God in the Court of heaven. And it is taken for the ſaving of a partie, in his own ſpirit and conſcience: if wee take it in the firſt ſence, a man is ſaved in the Court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, onely by grace. What is the Reaſon that (the accuſing mouth of the Law being ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped) no Bill, no enditement can be brought againſt the Elect in the Court of Heaven? Is it not this, becauſe God in his grace juſtifieth them? This is the Apoſtles argument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth them.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? who can implead, or bring an action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them before God for breaking his Law? He that is the Judge of the Elect is their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier. Grace hath caſt out of Heaven <hi>the accuſer of the Brethren, which accuſed them before God night and day,</hi> Rev. 12.10. The accuſer can bring no enditement, complaint, or accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Saints there. There is no ſin in our conſciences that can be heard to accuſe us in heaven, becauſe there is grace for our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: God beholds his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt before his eye, upon whom he hath laid all our
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:180666:75"/>ſins. The bloud of Chriſt doth, with power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and undeniable arguments, plead for thoſe for whom it was ſhed. The ſtraying and ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſheep, which are within the reach of Gods eternall Grace, cannot be condemned; becauſe <hi>the good Shepheard hath given his life for the ſheep. Joh.</hi> 10.11. God knoweth that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſatisfaction before hand for their ſins, by the hand of the Lord Jeſus, who is not now to pay any thing, but hath already made pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all their debts: and <hi>is become the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the new Covenant of Grace,</hi> which is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his own bloud: under which Covenant upon this conſideration, there can be no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſin,</hi> Heb. 10.14. God beholding his Elect in their propitiation; and alwayes hearing the ſweet voice of their wrath-appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing advocate, making an heavenly melody in his eares. And alwayes beholding our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before himſelfe in heaven, lying wrapt up in his own grace; doth acquaint us in his word of truth; That wee are ſaved by grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly: If we take ſalvation in the other ſence; for ſalvation in our ſpirits and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and in this ſence we are ſaved by grace. There can be no ſalvation brought home to our hearts, but by the ſight of grace. If wee had the ſanctification of all the Saints which have lived ſince the fall of Man, and ſhould
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:180666:75"/>looke upon it all as ours, to give comfort to our ſoules, and to aſſure us that wee are in a ſtate of ſalvation; and ſhould not looke above it, to behold Gods grace, and our ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it, and from it, it would not give us any ſolid comfort, or aſſurance of our falvation. Nothing can ſhine in the heart to give it any comfort, but what doth ſhine and give light, in the light and beames of this grace. Wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to ſee our ſelves in a condition of ſafety, till wee ſee the grace of God. <hi>Looke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee and be ſaved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none elſe,</hi> Iſaiah 45.22. None but God can ſave us, and nothing but the ſight of God can bring ſalvation to us. Still wee have ſome objection or other againſt ſalvation, and juſtification, till God ſilence all objections by the ſight of his own grace. There is that onely in God, and in Jeſus Chriſt, that will ſilence all objections.</p>
               <p>If our conſcience flie in our faces, and tell us that wee have committed many thouſands of ſins more then wee can reckon or number up, yet when God gives us a ſight of himſelfe, his ſonne, and grace, the mouth of conſcience is ſtopped, and wee ſee all our ſins ſwallowed up in his love. <hi>Shew us the Father, and it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us,</hi> ſaith <hi>Philip.</hi> Joh. 14.8. When God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us himſelfe, our ſpirits are at reſt.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:180666:76"/>
               <p>When Grace is diſcovered, and Gods light doth ſhine upon the ſoule, Sin, death, &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation cannot terrifie the ſoule. But they are filled with a ſpirit of joy, in beleeving their free juſtification; <hi>who</hi> before <hi>through feare of death were ſubject to bondage,</hi> Heb. 2.15. Grace appeareth greater and ſtronger to bring ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then ſinne powerfull to bring damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our ſins, &amp; the ſins of all the man of the world, being the acts of creatures are finite; but grace that juſtifieth us, is the grace of an infinite God, and is boundleſſe and infinite. Men are unaſſured of their ſalvation, unleſſe this Grace be preſented to the eye of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And men and Devills cannot prevaile againſt us, to enforce us to queſtion our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and ſalvation, when wee looke upon it. That <hi>peace</hi> which <hi>the world cannot take from us,</hi> nor <hi>give unto us;</hi> that joy which neither the Law, nor the workes of the Law can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unto us, nor bereave us off: that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which damned Feinds can never rob us of; is communicated to us by the beholding of Gods grace in the face of the Lord Jeſus. The ſoule, when it hath a ſight of this grace, it ſtands <hi>with boldneſſe</hi> at <hi>the Throne of Grace,</hi> and though it feele helliſh ſin in it ſelfe, yet, it is able to diſpute with all the Divels in Hell, and to maintaine the freeneſſe, fulneſſe, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:180666:76"/>compleatneſſe, of its own juſtification from all ſin, by the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If the Divell ſhall then ſuggeſt this to a man, that he is a ſinner. The beleeving ſoule will make this anſwer. It is true, I am a ſinner; but I am not terrified to deſparation, becauſe I am ungodly; but I rejoyce in this that <hi>God juſtifieth the ungodly</hi> by his grace; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. If the Divell ſhall reply: But thou art a great ſinner, and there is a great damnation. The believing ſoule will returne, I am not tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the great damnation prepared for great ſinners, but comforted by the <hi>great ſalvation;</hi> (Heb. 2.3.) which is for the greateſt and cheifeſt of ſinners by Gods grace in Jeſus Chriſt (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.) If the Divell ſhall ſtill aſſault a man, to perſwade him that he is a damned ſoule, having miſpent his time and ſtrength in the ſervice of ſin, having no good workes to commend him unto God, that he may finde favour from him. The beleeving ſoule will be eaſily able in the ſtrength of God, when it is upon the mountaine of his Grace, to ſilence the Accuſer, by lying downe in the lap of that God, who maketh him the object of his Grace, who worketh not for juſtification (Rom. 4.) but <hi>beleiveth in God who juſtifieth ſinners</hi> in his Grace, without workes. And becauſe wee are juſtified and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:180666:77"/>comforted in the Court of our owne Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by grace: The ſpirit which is given forth in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is called a ſpirit of grace: It being the worke of the Spirit to reveale the grace of the Father for the comfort of his children; according to that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, and God even our Father, which hath loved us, and given us everlaſting conſolation, and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts.</hi> Heere the Apoſtle ſheweth us that the Saints have conſolation, and that this conſolation is everlaſting, and that this everlaſting conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is only by grace. Goe to all the true Saints in the world, and aske them how they received the Comforter, whether by the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of moral precepts, or by the doctrine of grace, &amp; they will informe you that they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, by the Goſpel of grace, and not by the law of works: Some Saints are able to acquaint you with their own experience, &amp; can tell you, how they laboured for holineſs, to bring them to happineſſe; to love God, that they might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelves, that they were in the love of God, and that they found darkneſſe inſtead of expected light, death inſtead of life, horrour &amp; bondage inſtead of joy and liberty, untill they were enabled to come unto God as ſinners, without workes, diſclaming their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:180666:77"/>deſerts and endeavours, and laying the <hi>head-ſtone</hi> of their peace and happineſſe in the free favour of God, crying Grace, Grace, <hi>Zech:</hi> 4: 7. Exalting the free grace of God in their juſtification, and overthrowing &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning their own works and legal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It is <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> alone, <hi>which bringeth ſalvation.</hi> Tit: 2.11. and therefore not our workes. Grace and workes are inconſiſtent in this point of juſtification: they can no more ſtand together, then the Arke of God and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. Let grace ſtand up in its glory, &amp; workes will quickly be overthrown, and ſet up works, and yee deſtroy the doctrine of grace. By eternall grace wee <hi>were elected,</hi> and <hi>made veſſells of mercy from eternitie;</hi> by grace we were ſaved before God in heaven, in the preſence of the Lord Ieſus: by grace wee were ſaved in the perſon of Chriſt before faith. By the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace unto us through faith wee are ſaved <hi>(in foro conſcientiae)</hi> in the Court of our owne conſciences. By grace ſalvation is inchoated here, and compleated, and perfected hereafter. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult: The gift of God is cter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life through Jeſu Chriſt our Lord.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifieth a gift flowing from Grace, or free favour. In theſe ſeverall accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the word grace, <hi>we are ſaved by grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might now lay downe many reaſons, for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:180666:78"/>the proofe of this poynt, but thoſe, which I gave to proove, that wee are not juſtified by workes, will bee ſufficient for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this. And when I ſhall handle the doctrine of beleiving ſome reaſons will fall in which will more fully illuſtrate this truth. I ſhall therefore for the preſent onely preſent unto you a reaſon or two, and haſten to the uſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Firſt, it being ſuppoſed that man is a ſinner, it is impoſſible that man ſhould bee ſaved by any thing, but by the knowledge of Grace.</p>
               <p>The Law in this particular, would not deale with us, conſidering what good hath bin done by us, but what evill. And therefore when the Apoſtle had proved, <hi>Bom.</hi> 3.23. that devout <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as prophane <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, had ſinned,</hi> and <hi>come ſhort of the glory of God:</hi> he takes it for granted, as a thing undeniable and unqueſtionable, that wee are <hi>juſtified free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his grace, through the redemption that is in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And if we could bring our ſelves into a ſtate of perfection, after we have once ſinned, wee could not be juſtified by that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in us, which is required by the Law, but ſhould be condemned for our ſinnes, and imperfections in breaking of the Law.</p>
               <p>If a man have done good ſervice for the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:180666:78"/>Common-wealth; and yet be found guilty of high Treaſon againſt the State, the Law will condemne him for the Treaſon, his good ſervice not being availeable to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to the juſtice of the Law for this Treaſon. So if it were poſſible for us to keepe the Law for a time, wee ſhould be condemned, if it can be proved that wee have broken it at any time. Acts of obedience will not make ſatisfaction for acts of diſobedience. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſatisfie the juſtice of the Law, by doing what the Law requires, if we have once bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it. If we could ſometimes doe what the Law requires us, we ſhould not be able to free our ſelves from the guilt and puniſhment for doing that, which it forbiddeth us at all times; becauſe it requireth obedience from us, at all times. And it is unreaſonable to thinke that God, if he deale with us as under the Law, and not under Grace, ſhould give us a pardon of our diſobedience, in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our obedience.</p>
               <p>If a wife live honeſtly, as becomes a wife, ſome few yeares; if her huband finde that ſhe committed Adultery ſome yeares before the time of her honeſty &amp; obedience, the Law takes no notice at all, that ſhe hath lived in her latter time as became a wife: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes her; &amp; ſhe muſt be divourced from her
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:180666:79"/>husband for her adultrous act committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her obedience.</p>
               <p>So if it were poſſible that wee could keepe the Law, and doe what is required in it, and live under the obedience of it, in every branch and point of it, yet if we have once broken the Law, the Law, taking no notice of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would condemne us for our diſobedience. What the <hi>Roman</hi> hyſtorian ſaith of the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, that it is <hi>(dura et inexorabilis)</hi> ſevere and inexorable, it is true of Gods Law. The Law heareth no cry or begging for mercy. No man ſhall finde favour or pardon from the Law, by any acts of obedience to the Law, who hath once diſobeyed the Law.</p>
               <p>The paying of a new debt will not make ſatisfaction to a man to whom an old debt is owing: ſo if wee could pay the debt that the Law requires for the preſent, it makes no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction at all for our breaking it before, for our old debt.</p>
               <p>By this conſideration, in the firſt place, it will be evident to every man who hath any ſpirituall knowledge of the purity, and juſtice of the Law, that it is impoſſible for ſinfull man to finde out any way, but the good old way of Grace, to happineſſe and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee are juſtified by grace; that God may have the glory of his grace. Man
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:180666:79"/>fell by pride, therefore God will not eſtate him in happineſſe but by humbling him, by bringing him upon his knees to the Throne of Grace, that he may have the glory of his grace. Naturally we are full of pride, and would riſe by that, by which wee fell: wee would be made happy by workes, as wee are made unhappy by workes. Every man that ſees himſelfe, ſees how that the whole ſtreame of corrupt nature runs this way: man will be doing, working, and acting that he may be juſtified. But God will not ſuffer ſinfull man to glory, before him in his owne workes, leaſt he ſhould looſe the glory of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. and therefore there is no ſalvation for us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till wee lie downe at the doore of grace. If God <hi>enter into judgement no man living ſhall be juſtified in his ſight,</hi> Pſal. 143.2. God doth ſtop up all other waies to ſalvation, but the way of grace, that he may have the glory of his grace in juſtifing the objects and veſſells of his grace. God doth not ſo much intend mans ſalvation by grace, as his owne glory and praiſe. He formeth his people for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that they may be happy in himſelfe, and with himſelfe, and they may <hi>ſhew forth his praiſe,</hi> Pſal. 43.21. It is the minde and pleaſure of God that every man ſhould glory in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; therefore he juſtifies and ſaves us onely
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:180666:80"/>by that Grace which is in himſelfe. <hi>In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified,</hi> and ſhall glory. And the Apoſtle when he had dicourſed of the grace of God in our <hi>election predeſtination,</hi> and <hi>adoption,</hi> doth ſweetly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that grace doth ſtreame forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in all theſe particulars, that it may be to <hi>the praiſe of the glory of his grace,</hi> Epheſ. 1.5, 6. He maketh us objects of grace that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from us, and wee be enabled to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>the glory of his grace.</hi> All the Saints are brought forth ſtanding before the Throne, and ſinging forth this truth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our God which ſitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lambe.</hi> They aſcribe ſalvation not to their owne workes, merits, deſervings, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſſe, but to the grace of God and blood of the <hi>Lambe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As earthly and groſe bodies cannot mount up to Heaven, which is a place of puritie and perfection, but they fall downe by their owne weight to the earth, unable to aſcend thether. So our works, fall downe to the ground, as unable to aſcend up to the place of Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and glory to juſtifie us in his ſight; that ſalvation may be attributed onely to his owne grace. And he will not juſtifie us in the court of our owne conſciences, wee ſhall not read our names written in heaven, till hee bring us
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:180666:80"/>from our owne workes, righteouſneſſe, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and endeavours, to reſt upon the ſtrong arme of his grace that we may give him the <hi>glory of his grace,</hi> in our free juſtification and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God ſaves us by Grace, becauſe if it were not by grace, it had beene needleſſe that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhould have beene given to us: If it had been poſſible for man to have wrought out his owne ſalvation by his own workes, there had been no need that the Son of God ſhould have diſroabed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of his glory, and been made man like us. Why ſhould he have lived a life of ſorrow, and died a death of ſhame, had it been poſſible for us to have gotten ſalvation by our own works? Therefore the Apoſtle concludes, that <hi>if righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe had been by the Law, then Chriſt had dyed in vaine.</hi> And thus have I opened to you, and ſhewed you the reaſons why wee are ſaved by grace. In aword now to make a little uſe of it, and ſo I ſhall conclude for the preſent.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, that which I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered concerning the eternall grace of God, ſufficiently confutes that error which is in the ſpirits of many men, who thinke that workes and actings of the creature is the cauſe of Gods love to the creature. God doth not love us, becauſe wee love him, but we love God,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:180666:81"/>becauſe he firſt loved us from eternity. God doth not begin to love us, when wee are made new creatures, but God loveth us that we may be new creatures. Faith is not the Antecedent cauſe, but conſequent of election, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not by workes of righteouſneſſe which wee have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration and renewing of the holy Spirit.</hi> By this paſſage it is evident, that mercy doth precede regeneration, and is the cauſe of ſpirituall renovation. Vocation and juſtification by faith doe follow predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeake the truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called: and whom he called them he alſo juſtified, and whom he juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them he alſo glorified.</hi> God loved us when wee had no beings in our ſelves, or among any creatures, to aſſure us that he did not love us for any thing in us, there being nothing at all in us when God firſt loved us.</p>
               <p>The love of God is not like the love of man, man loves ſomething which he ſees lovely but God ſees nothing in the object which he loves, but all the motives and arguments lie in the boſome and breaſt of God, which move him to love his creature. Man cannot love before he have ſome lovely object propoſed to him, but God loves before we have either being or holineſſe: Wee beleive in God, love him, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:180666:81"/>are made lovely before him in time, becauſe he loved us before all time. The man ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wiſe doth ſee his happyneſſe wrapt up in the eternall bowells of Grace, and laid up in the everlaſting boſome of unchangeable love for him. Fond therefore is there conceit, ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low there apprehenſion, and underſtandings dull, who beleeve that any thing done, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved by the creature in time, can be the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary cauſe of the creatures ſalvation, to whom grace was given for ſalvation from eternity 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This doctrine of free grace doth overthrow and annihilate the wiſdome of the wiſe, the learning of the learned, the righteouſneſſe of him who is moſt righteous, and a ſtranger to grace. The naturall man with his beſt ſight ſeeth not a righteouſneſſe beyond the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of his own righteouſneſſe. As the wiſdome of the ſpirit, is fooliſhneſſe to the naturall man; ſo the wiſdome of the fleſh is fooliſhneſſe with God. Though there be a ſpirit in a man by which he may have great knowledge and underſtanding in the things of nature and reaſon, yet <hi>it is the ſpirit of the Almighty which giveth underſtanding,</hi> Job. 32.8. Untill this ſpirit and power from above come upon us, <hi>wee call light darkneſſe, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe light;</hi> ſinfulneſſe purity, purity imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:180666:82"/>But when this doth enter into us, <hi>all our righteouſneſſes appeare as filthy raggs,</hi> and we are made willing to reſt upon that grace for righteouſneſſe, <hi>which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. Then wee clearly ſee the wiſdome of God in ſhewing <hi>mercy on whom he will ſhew mercy,</hi> and having compaſſion on whome he will have compaſſion: Then we cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that <hi>it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> Then the objections of camall reaſon are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered, the acute arguments of the wordly wiſe and learned, againſt free grace, are diſſolved, the Sophiſmes of the Antigrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are ſufficiently confuted, and we are ſaved and ſatisfied with the glorious diſcoveries of Gods eternall grace in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Againe, this ſhould engage us all, that know this ſaving grace to exalt and extoll this grace of our heavenly Father. Grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by us doth oblige us unto thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. It is fit that they ſhould glorifie God for his grace, who ſee themſelves glorified by grace. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſetteth forth this unto us Iſa. 45. laſt, <hi>In Jehovah ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory.</hi> He that is juſtified in the grace of <hi>Jehovah</hi> will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory in the grace of <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:180666:82"/>glory, not in our ſelves, not in our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſufferings, actings or endeavours, but in this grace of the Father, according to the advice of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord; Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdome, neither let the mighty man glory in his might: Let not the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth me; that I am the Lord, which exerciſe loving kindneſſe, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and righteouſneſſe in the earth.</hi> Let our holy boaſting be in this righteouſneſſe; Let the reſolution of the ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be the reſolution of every one of us <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.16. <hi>I will make mention of thy righteouſneſſe, even of thine onely.</hi> God forbid, ſaith <hi>Paul, that I ſhould glory in any thing, ſave in the Croſſe of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So let every good Chriſtian ſay, God forbid that I ſhould glory ſave in the grace of God; Let <hi>Phariſees</hi> and Hypocriter boaſt of their owne workes and legall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. But let true Saints boaſt onely of the grace of the mercifull and favourable <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovah.</hi> What is ingenuouſly acknowledged concerning himſelfe, by <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am;</hi> may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all Saints. By grace wee are what we are, and therefore glory is to be given to grace. Gods gracious love was placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:180666:83"/>us before wee were lovely, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>He loved us with an everlaſting love.</hi> He loved us when we were unlovely, when he <hi>ſaw us pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our blood,</hi> then <hi>was the time of his love,</hi> Ezek. 16.6.8. His grace and love hath made us lovely: what cauſe then is there, that wee ſhould glory in this grace and love? It is an excellent ſpeech of <hi>Bernard</hi> to this purpoſe <hi>(Tibi illibata maneat gloria, meum benè agitur ſi pacem habuero.)</hi> Take thou all the glory, it is enough for us, that wee have the peace. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. the Pſalmiſt profeſſeth that if the Lord <hi>ſhould marke iniquities,</hi> no man <hi>ſhould</hi> be able to <hi>ſtand</hi> before him. <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldeſt marke iniquities: O Lord who ſhall ſtand?</hi> The interrogation is equivalent to a negation, <hi>who ſhall ſtand?</hi> that is, no man ſhall ſtand. Wee, that ſhould quickly fall to ruine, had wee no better ground to ſtand upon then our owne workes, what reaſon have we to bleſſe God for grace, who onely ſtand by grace?</p>
               <p>If we could ſtand before the judgement Seate of God, ſtanding cloathed in the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous raggs of our owne workes, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; performances, there were ſome ground for us to glory in our owne works: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is thus, that if God enter into Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deale with us by the Law, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand before him, therefore, let us glory

With heart and tongue give him praiſe for what he hath done for thee by his grace, who haſt cauſe to be aſhamed for what thou haſt done againſt his grace. A King of <hi>France</hi> thought himſelf bound to praiſe God, that God had made him a King and not a begger. What cauſe have wee to praiſe him for his grace, who of ſinners hath made us Saints. If devout <hi>Bradford,</hi> when he ſaw a blinde or a lame man, did take occaſion to bleſſe God for the uſe of his limbes, &amp; eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, is it not conſonant to reaſon, that wee ſhould publiſh forth the praiſes of Gods grace, who hath beſtowed ſpirituall life, light, and operations upon us.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle hath an high expreſſion to raiſe our ſpirits, to this purpoſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Now thanks be to God, which alwayes cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt.</hi> When men triumph there is great joy, rejoycing and ſhow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing. Wee are not onely to rejoyce, in his Grace, but wee ſhould triumph in it. A Chriſtian may ride in a Chariott of triumph every day; he may ſee his ſinnes, curſe, hell, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſubdued, and overcome, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds God, in the looking glaſſe of his owne grace. What though we have many ſinnes? yet for all this wee may triumph, becauſe the grace of God hath ſaved us from our ſinnes by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:180666:84"/>Chriſt. What though wee have no works? yet wee may triumph if wee know grace, there is enough for us in the fulneſſe of grace. There is no way to peace here, or glory hereafter, but by grace. Let grace therefore be thy glory. As the Apoſtle doth double his exhortation when he exhorteth them to rejoyce, that they might double their diligence and care in practiſe of their duty, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alway: and againe, I ſay rejoyce.</hi> So ſuffer me to double and treble my exhortation. Yee have nothing to boaſt in but grace, boaſt therefore: and againe I ſay boaſt in the grace of God.</p>
               <p>God ſeemes, in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to ſpeake to an Hypocriticall proud people, and he bids them bring forth their arguments, and <hi>put</hi> him <hi>in Remembrance,</hi> if there were any thing to be brought before him, for which they ſhould <hi>be juſtified,</hi> Iſa. 43.26. <hi>Let us plead together, declare thou that thou mayeſt be juſtified:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid. If you have any works; bring them out? uſe all your arguments, skill and Rhetoricke, ſay what you can for your ſelves to plead your juſtification. But, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that they could not ſtand before him with their workes for juſtification, he puts them in minde of their ſinnes, <hi>Thy firſt Father hath ſinned, and thy Teachers have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed

So it is with us (Brethren) as we have heard. Wee cannot bring forth ſufficient reaſons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to make good our ſalvation by our works. If we have nothing to comfort us but our owne works, wee ſhall have no comfort at all in his preſence. Let us therefore as we are ingaged, Trumpet out the praiſe of God, for the manifeſtation of his rich and precious grace to us in the face of Jeſus, for juſtification and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let me exhort you to abide in the. profeſſion of grace to the end of your dayes Hypocrites may profeſſe grace for a time, but true Saints ſhall <hi>hold faſt</hi> the doctrine of grace <hi>to the end,</hi> Joh. 8.31. <hi>If yee continue in my word then are yee my Diſciples indeed.

Let not the wiſe and learned of the world, cryed up for godlineſſe, Religion, and devotion, draw you from this grace of God.</p>
               <p>We live in dangerous, in perilous times, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:180666:85"/>there were never ſuch underminers of grace, as have appeared in theſe ſinfull dayes, ſome that deny the Lord that bought them: But let us not be diſcouraged, becauſe ſome, who have profeſſed grace, have fallen from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to fancy frothy Notions, Anti-Chriſtian abſurdities, and <hi>Familiſticall</hi> ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.

               <p>When the Goſpel is preached with, power there are multitudes come to the profeſſion of it, but after a while many of theſe fall to philoſophicall fancies, fooliſh dreames, vaine fables, and idle ſpeculations, loathing the plain Goſpel, the heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did the <hi>Manna that came downe from Heaven,</hi> this wee begin to finde by experience: But let not this ſhake us from our ſtedfaſtneſſe

               <p>Againe, Let not the Abuſers of grace cauſe you to diſlike grace, or the Doctrine of grace. By this the Divell may take great advantage againſt thee for thy hurt, thou maiſt have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:180666:86"/>thoughts of the grace of God, when thou eyeſt ſome who abuſe grace: but continue thou in grace, fall not from thy profeſſion, nor diſlike the preaching of it, becauſe thou obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt ſome who <hi>abuſe</hi> the grace of God, <hi>turning</hi> it <hi>into wantonneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Remember that in the times of the Apoſtle, ſome Goſpel Profeſſors did <hi>walke</hi> ſo <hi>contrary to the Goſpel,</hi> that tender-eyed <hi>Paul</hi> could not ſpeake of them without teares in his eyes, <hi>whoſe end</hi> was <hi>deſtruction, whoſe God</hi> was <hi>their belly, whoſe glory was there ſhame,</hi> who <hi>minded earthly things:</hi> Phil. 3. Yet theſe vile wretches would talke of grace, and the Doctrine of Chriſt, knowing nothing rightly of grace, or Chriſt; And <hi>Jude</hi> doth acquaint us with ſome in his time, that were <hi>crept in unawares, turning the grace of our God into laſciviouſneſſe.</hi> And he ſaith that they, <hi>were ordained to this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) written downe long before <hi>to this condemnation,</hi> ſo the word ſignifieth: for as God hath appointed ſome to ſalvation, ſo he hath appointed ſome to damnation; and theſe urgodly men are of the number of the damned. We wonder to ſee a generation of men ſprung up among us, that make nothing of Chriſt or the Father: wee wonder to ſee men undervaluing and vilifying the grace of God, neglecting all Chriſtian
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:180666:86"/>duties, and denying the word of God to be the word of God. But it was ſo in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, there were ſuch crept into their Congregations: and why ſhould it ſeeme a ſtrange thing unto us, that it is ſo now in theſe dayes of <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> confuſion and <hi>Egyptian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darkneſſe,</hi> ſeeing it was ſo in the bright dayes of light, in which the Apoſtles lived, who Prophecyed that <hi>in</hi> theſe <hi>latter dayes perilous times</hi> ſhould <hi>come, and men</hi> ſhould <hi>depart from the faith?</hi> That wee may not ſtumble in our Chriſtian race at theſe abuſers and ſcandalizers of grace, let us know that grace is grace though men abuſe it: think not, that grace is not grace becauſe it is abuſed: but know that the true doctrine of grace may and muſt be abuſed by wicked and ungodly men. As the ſpider ſucks poyſon where the Bee ſucks honey: So where the Saints ſuck ſweetneſſe and honey, the wicked and ungodly men ſuck poyſon. Where the godly fetch all their joy and comfort, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and refreſhment, there wicked men meet with their ruine and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The wayes of Gods truth and grace are right, and the juſt and faithfull ſhall walke ſafely in them but the tranſgreſſors ſhall fall therein,</hi> Hoſea. 14.9.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:180666:87"/>and fall into condemnation.</p>
               <p>A Libertine hearing the doctrine of Grace ſucks nothing but his bane from it. Though the word be <hi>the ſavour of life unto life to them that believe;</hi> yet is it <hi>the ſavour of death unto death</hi> to ſome, 2 Cor. 2.16. I remember one ſaith of Medicaments, that if they be given by a skilfull Phyſitian, they are the helpfull hands of God <hi>(auxiliares dei manus)</hi> but if by one that is unskilfull, they are poyſon. So the doctrine of grace, when it is skilfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, when the Spirit of God teacheth us to make a right uſe of it, <hi>it is the power of God to ſalvation,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, which is the power of God to ſalvation, to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 1.16. But when it is unskilfully applyed, when the fleſh only makes uſe of this doctrine of grace, and there is not the ſpirit of God to teach us to make a right uſe of it, wee turne it into venome and wee are poyſoned to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But let us not be offended at the doctrine of Chriſt for this. It hath bin ſo formerly, it is ſo and will be ſo. Nevertheleſſe let us continue in the grace of God, and looke up to God that wee may continue in it.</p>
               <p>I have one worde now to ſpeake unto thoſe, who for the preſent are not apprehendors
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:180666:87"/>and partakers of this grace, and ſhall conclude for this preſent: You ſee it is onely by grace that you are ſaved; it is only grace that brings ſalvation to the ſonnes and daughters of men: Therefore, if God hath convinced you that you are ſinners; now is the day of grace: now is the day of ſalvation. I will ſhew a ſhort and compendious but a true way to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, happy are all you that beleeve what is brought to your eares this day concerning Gods free grace. God promiſed to <hi>meet</hi> his people <hi>at the mercy-Seate</hi> Exod. 25. which was a type of Chriſt, and wee can never meet with God to the ſalvation of our ſoules, but by meeting with his grace in the Lord Jeſus. The Law is the miniſtery of death, it is the Goſpel of grace which is the miniſtery of life and ſalvation; Looke therefore beyond <hi>the Law,</hi> which is <hi>a miniſtery of condemnation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> beyond thy own righteouſneſſe, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity to the eye of Juſtice, beholding thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law: beyond thy ſelfe, who art an object of miſery, horrour and confuſion, and by a ſpirituall eye of Gods owne making, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his grace in Chriſt for loſt and undone ſinners. Hearken to what God ſpeakes to thee, he invites thee, exhorts thee, and beſeecheth thee to be reconciled: he tells thee that thou canſt not be juſtified by thine owne workes,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:180666:88"/>but by his free grace, that thou art not to be ſaved by what thou haſt done, but by what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered. Though thou haſt broaken the Law: Jeſus Chriſt hath kept it. <hi>He is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe, for every one that beleeveth</hi> in and by the grace of God. Behold God ſtanding at the doore of thy heart in the Miniſtery of the Goſpel of grace and ſalvation, let the doore of thy hears fly open unto him by beleeving, and he will feaſt thy ſoule. As Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> ſo I may ſay to thee, who beleeveſt what I ſpeake, <hi>this day ſalvation is come into thine houſe.</hi> God is the God of grace, therefore thinke not to pleaſe him by any thing but by eyeing of his grace: Chriſt is the Sonne of grace, he came to reveale the grace of his Father: If thou wouldeſt with <hi>Simeon</hi> take Chriſt and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thine armes, graſpe not thine owne workes for juſtification, but beleeve what is proclaymed forth to the world concerning ſalvation onely by grace. The Spirit is the Spirit of grace, and if thou beleeve thou ſhalt be aſſured of, &amp; <hi>ſealed</hi> to redemption by grace. There is no ſalvation but by grace, and no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of grace but by beleeving, which is the next thing preſented in the Text to our conſideration. Salvation is not by working but beleeving: yee are ſaved by grace through
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:180666:88"/>faith. But wee muſt be enforced to let alone the fuller enlarging of this point, untill God ſhall give us another opportunity. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I have done. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>

Grace is the principall cauſe of our juſtification, faith is the Organ or inſtrument, given unto us by God, for the diſcovery and application of his grace unto our own ſouls. As no rational man (when he readeth thoſe words of our Saviour to the <hi>woman, who was diſeaſed with an iſſue of blood,</hi> Mat. 9.22. <hi>Daughter be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole;</hi>) would conclude, that becauſe our Saviour ſaith that her <hi>faith</hi> did make <hi>her whole,</hi> that therefore ſhe was not made whole by Jeſus Chriſt as the principall cauſe. So no ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all man ſhould conclude, that we are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by grace as the principall cauſe, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>wee are ſaved through faith.</hi> Deſireing therefore that that crowne may ſtand faſt, which God hath ſet upon the head of his owne grace. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you, that wee are ſaved by faith, or through
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:180666:90"/>faith. Wee are not ſaved in a way of working but beleeving. Thus God ſaved and juſtified, the Father of the faithfull; to teach his ſonnes in what way they are to expect ſalvation. God <hi>in a viſion</hi> informeth <hi>Abraham</hi> that he was his <hi>ſhield, and exceeding great reward</hi> Gen. 15.6. <hi>And he beleeved in the Lord and he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> This was the Oracle of truth which <hi>Habakkuk, ſtanding upon his watch,</hi> received from the Lord, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Behold his ſoule, who is lifted up in him, is not upright, but the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> It is by beleeving, and not by working, that wee are made juſt. (<hi>Fides juſtos ab injuſtis, non operum ſed ipſa fidei lege, diſcernit.</hi> Aug.) Truth doth make a difference betwixt the juſt and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, not by the Law of workes, but by the law of faith. The naturall man knoweth no righteouſneſſe but what is by his own workes. The ſpirituall man doth ſee himſelfe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in beleeving. Thus our Saviour directed the ignorant <hi>Jewes</hi> to the right way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe when they asked him <hi>what</hi> they ſhould <hi>do that they might work the works of God,</hi> Io. 6.28 This is the work of God, ſaith he, that <hi>ye beleeve on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> If any enquire after ſalvation let him know it is not by works. The plaine way to ſalvation and juſtification, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by beleeving. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>The grace of God bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:180666:90"/>ſalvation, teaching us to deny all ungodlineſſe, &amp; wordly luſts.</hi> He doth not ſay that grace in the firſt place, teaches us <hi>to deny ungodlines &amp; world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts:</hi> but in the firſt place it brings juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſalvation through beleeving, &amp; then ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily the ſame grace teacheth us, <hi>to deny ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines &amp; worldly luſts.</hi> After we have believed for ſalvation, the holy ſpirit is given <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. In beleeving <hi>we enter into our reſt,</hi> Heb. 4.3. keep the yeare of <hi>Iubile,</hi> &amp; ſee our ſelves unſtated in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, and keep a chriſtian <hi>Sabbath.</hi> It is only in beleeving that wee are brought to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that felicity, which is by the grace of God, in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles, in their Epiſtles, doe not hold forth any truth more frequently then this. Gal 5.6. <hi>In Jeſus Chriſt, neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by Love.</hi> And Ro. 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> When the Keeper of the Priſon asked <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Silas,</hi> what they ſhould <hi>doe to be ſaved,</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſalvation was only attainable by working, they did at one diſcover unto him, his error, &amp; blindneſſe; &amp; acquainted him with the ſoul-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving truth of the Goſpel, aſſuring him, that if he beleeved <hi>on the Lord Jeſus, he ſhould be ſaved</hi> Acts 16.31. We find not reſt in our ſpirits by the ſight of our works, love, ſincerity, labours, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:180666:91"/>but by the ſight of Gods grace in Chriſt</p>
               <p>Having by theſe places of Scripture, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to you this truth: I ſhall now amplyfie it, by ſhewing unto you more fully, how it may be in truth affirmed, that we are ſaved through faith. In the firſt place, it is by faith, and by faith alone, not by faith joyned with workes, but by faith without workes. I deny not, but where true faith is, workes will follow: yet ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is through faith without workes. When wee are brought into the boſome of the Lord Ieſus, wee enter not into the boſome of his love, by our love and faith together, but by faith which produceth Love. Our eyes are ſhut to the beholding all things in our ſelves, and the eyes of our ſpirits are enlightned, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what is in Gods Grace, and the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Conſonant to this, is <hi>Pauls</hi> ſweete and comfortable concluſion Rom. 3.28. <hi>Wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a man is juſtified by faith, without the deeds of the Law.</hi> Love to God and his people, is a worke commanded by the Law; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Pauls concluſion of truth, wee <hi>are juſtified by faith, without the deedes of the Law:</hi> therefore we are juſtified by faith, without love to God, or his people.</p>
               <p>When God diſcovers his Grace to a man, for his juſtification, hee ſhewes him, that, as his evill workes, cannot bring damnation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:180666:91"/>him, ſo his good workes cannot bee availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for his juſtification. That aſſurance of Gods love, which ſome profeſſors have got, by the ſight of their owne workes, being never il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated in their underſtandings, to behold Gods Grace, in the light and beames of Grace; is not the true aſſurance of the goſpell, but the deceit, and lying divination of their owne ſpirits, concerning their owne happineſſe; for ſalvation is by faith without workes. God doth not require us to doe good workes for ſalvation in the conſcience, but doth poſitively and abſolutely exclude them, as things, which have no influence at al upon that firſt aſſurance, which he doth give unto his people of his love, which is by a pure ſimple unmixed act of faith.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of Grace is never given to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us, untill God hath ſtripped us of our owne righteouſneſſe, workes, and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and hath brought us to the Throne of Grace, to bee juſtified by free Grace, without any thing in our ſelves, that may make us fit for juſtification, and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle doth lay downe this, as a truth ſeconded by his owne experience, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all true Saints, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that, <hi>a man is not juſtified by the workes of the Law, but by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt: even wee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have beleeved in Ieſus Chriſt, that we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:180666:92"/>might bee juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the workes of the Law, for by the workes of the Law ſhall no fleſh bee juſtified.</hi> It is not (as the Papiſts ſay) that faith, which hath love joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it, which they make the forme of faith, by which wee are juſtified, but it is by faith without any workes at all, by which wee are juſtified and have peace of conſcience. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> doth plainely lay downe his judgement in this point according to truth <hi>(Noli preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere de operibus ante fidem, quia peccatorem te fides invenit: etſi te fides data, facit juſtum, impium invenit, quem faceret juſtum.)</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not upon thy workes done before faith, becauſe faith findeth thee a ſinner, faith hath made thee juſt, it found thee wicked, whom it ſhould make juſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon why it is thus by faith alone, is, becauſe it is by grace: unleſſe we were juſtified by faith, we were not, we could not be juſtified by Grace This reaſon the Apoſtle lays downe Rom. 4.16. <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it might bee by Grace:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, unleſſe you hold, that there is a juſtification by faith alone without workes, you deny Grace: if you will bee juſtified by faith and workes conjoyned, you deſtroy Grace. Therefore it is by faith alone that it may be by Grace. When we have a true ſight of Grace, wee ſee a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:180666:92"/>in that Grace, to doe us good for our juſtification, and ſalvation, ſoe that there is nothing needfull, &amp; neceſſary beſides grace. In which reſpect <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, that workes are not neceſſary to juſtification, but pernitious to ſalvation: the goſpell requiring faith only; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle Gal. 3.12. <hi>The Law is not of faith:</hi> the law hath nothing to doe with beleeving, that doctrine which bids a man to beleeve that he may bee ſaved, that is the doctrine of the goſpell, the law biddeth us not to beleeve, but the man that doth it, ſhall live in it. The law bids us worke, but the Goſpell bids us beleeve, not worke, and beleive, but beleive only.</p>
               <p>We confound the Covenant of workes, and the Covenant of Grace, if wee preſſe an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of doing good workes for juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This was the Divinity of the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucker, <hi>Biſhop Bonner,</hi> who in a Sermon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding this queſt. <hi>How grace is to be applyed to us for juſtification,</hi> doth anſwer, by beleeving rightly, and living uprightly, joyning faith and holineſſe, for juſtification by grace: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the Scripture of truth, it is manifeſt that faith alone doth lay hold of Chriſt, and doth appropriate him unto us: And that holineſſe doth flow and ſtreame from the apprehenſion of our free juſtification by grace, through faith
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:180666:93"/>alone; though faith is not alone, but is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with other fruits of the Spirit which follow it. This muſt be well underſtood, or elſe we ſhall nullifie the grace of God: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God enableth true beleevers to ſee this truth plainly, and clearly. <hi>(Vileſceret redemptio ſanguinis Chriſti nec miſerecordiae dei humanorum operum praerogativa ſuccumberet, ſi juſtificatio, quae ſit per gratiam, meretis precedentibus debere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Ambroſ:</hi>) Redemption by the blood of Chriſt would be vilified, the prerogative of mans workes would not ſtoop to Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if juſtification, which is by grace, were due to preceding workes.</p>
               <p>A man that truely beleives, he ſees not any holineſſe, or qualification in himſelfe, that makes him more worthy of ſalvation then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man, he ſees that he hath deſerved dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as well as any one, who is now in the place of torment, and yet, hee ſees that ſuch is the Grace, the unſpeakeable grace of God to his poore ſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, that though he deſerve to lye as low in hell as <hi>Iudas,</hi> for his ſin, yet he ſhall be raiſed as high as heaven, by the grace of the father, made knowne to him in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Brethren, if upon examination, you finde that your joy, comfort and aſſurance, have, in the firſt place, proceeded from any workes, which you have in your ſelves, which make
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:180666:93"/>you conclude that you ſhall rather be ſaved then another man, your aſſurance is not a right aſſurance: But if your aſſurance be right, it is by beleeving that which is reported concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace of God; that ſo ſalvation may be by grace.</p>
               <p>It is poſſible for men to deceive themſelves, in obtaining an aſſurance of Gods love, and their happineſſe, (therefore I will a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe to open this to the ignorant.) It may be thou takeſt comfort to thy ſelfe, by looking on workes wrought by thy ſelfe, and not by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt: it may be thou conceiveſt, that thou loveſt God, and from thence concludeſt, that God loveth thee, though thou haſt not ſeen his free love to ſinners, this is a baſtardly aſſurance, brought forth by thine owne lying ſpirit, and not the true aſſurance of the Spirit of grace in beleeving. In a true aſſurance by faith, God hath the glory of his grace. But in this kind of aſſurance, God hath not the glory of his grace, therefore it is not a true aſſurance. Another deceiveth his ſoule, and thinketh hee is in a good condition, becauſe he reſteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a promiſe of God. Chriſt ſaith Mat. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> A man doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend himſelfe to be heavy laden, and from the ſight of his burthen, doth conclude hee
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:180666:94"/>hath reſt, and is in a good condition: but hee deceiveth himſelfe with a falſe perſwaſion; for the promiſe is not made to the qualification of wearineſſe, but the promiſe is made to the commers to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Cain</hi> was heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with his ſin, and it lay ſo heavy on him that he concluded that the puniſhment was greater then he was able to beare, or elſe that his ſin was greater then it could be forgiven, and yet died miſerable without mercy. Wee find that the ſin of <hi>Judas</hi> lay ſo heavy on him, that he repented that he had ſhed innocent blood, yet for all this hee went to his owne place.</p>
               <p>Therefore if thy comfort, and aſſurance come from a ſight of what is in thy ſelfe, and not from the diſcovery of grace, as it is layd forth in the Spirit of grace, thy aſſurance will not advantage thee in the day of wrath. Though God hath convinced thee of ſin, and there may be ſome legall repentance, &amp; refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metion wrought in thee, and ſomething which thou mayſt miſcall a true love to God, thou canſt not from the ſight of theſe things rightly conclude that thou art in the love of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a diſcovery of free love be made forth to thee a ſinner. For God doth not apply his grace or his Sonne to any man for juſtification but through beleeving, that juſtification may
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:180666:94"/>evidently appeare to the ſons of men to bee by his owne grace. Which will appeare, if in the third place, we doe more fully conſider, that God doth ſave us through beleeving, that hee may have the glory of his grace.</p>
               <p>God, as hee is glorious in his grace, by which hee juſtifies ſinners, ſo he will be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the hearts and conſciences of thoſe who are juſtified by grace, that he may have the ful glory of his grace, when he hath juſtified them. (<hi>Non eſt quò gratia intret, ubi jam meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum occupavit.</hi> Bern.) There is no roome for the glory of Gods grace, where the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our workes hath filled up the place. Where the creature may have glory in his owne workes; there God loſeth the glory of his grace. Where God doth any thing for the creature by grace, there it is not of our works, <hi>otherwiſe grace is no more grace. If it be of workes, then it is no more of grace, otherwiſe work is no more work.</hi> Rom. 11.6. Therefore God, will not juſtifie us in doing the workes of the Law, in giving us a ſight of any thing, that may make us more worthy of juſtification then other men; but he makes knowne his grace to us in a way of beleeving.</p>
               <p>The property of faith is to emptie the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to diſcover the fulneſſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Our owne workes, they puff us up, but
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:180666:95"/>faith empties us. It wee could be juſtified and ſaved by that which we have done, we might <hi>boaſt</hi> and rejoyce in it <hi>before God Rom.</hi> 4.2. But becauſe God will humble us, bring us low, lay us upon our backs, and tumble us in the duſt, that we may ſee our ſelves nothing, and ſee his grace all in all to us for our juſtification, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God juſtifies us onely in beleeving. Faith layes the creature low, and ſets the grace of God on high; that wee may goe to heaven admiring the grace of God to ſuch ſinners, ſuch baſe and vile wretches as wee are: therefore God will not juſtifie and ſave us in the court of our owne Conſciences, by the ſight of our owne workes, but onely by the ſight of his owne grace: thus it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>he ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God by unbeliefe, but being ſtrong in faith, he gave glory to God</hi> Rom. 4.20. When God comes downe upon us, and works faith in our hearts, and wee ſtagger not at the promiſes of Grace by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe; but give credit to what he hath ſpoken and promiſed: God hath that glory from us, that he will have from all thoſe, whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſave. Unbeleife robs man of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, &amp; God of his glory. By faith the creature is comforted, and the Creator exalted: through faith man is emptied of ſelfe-confidences, and filled with God and his praiſes; therefore
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:180666:95"/>for this reaſon are wee ſaved through faith.</p>
               <p>Againe, Fourthly it is by faith, becauſe it is onely by beleeving that wee behold the grace that is in God, by which he forgives ſin. Mans happineſſe for the preſent doth not lye in the not having of ſin, but in the grace of God not imputing ſin. (<hi>Noſtra juſticia eſt dei indulgentia</hi>) Gods favour and indulgence is our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thus the Pſalmiſt doth deſcribe the Bleſſed man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32 <hi>Bleſſed is the man, whoſe iniquities are paraoned, and whoſe ſinnes are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Hierome</hi> doth ſweetly paraphraſe't upon thoſe words <hi>(Quod tegitur non videtur, quod non videtur non imputatur, quod non imputatur non punietur)</hi> that which is covered is not ſeen, that which is not ſeen is not imputed, that which is not imputed, ſhall not be puniſhed. But by what is it, that man beholdeth himſelfe in this happineſſe? It is onely by beleeving, and therefore wee are ſaved through faith. Wee cannot ſee a nonimputation of ſin by the grace of God, but by the work of the ſpirit, in an act of beleeving; by which wee are aſſured, that it ſhall goe well with our ſoules to all eternity. And the great controverſie is decided and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the ſpirit of a man, <hi>whether he ſhall be ſaved, or whether he ſhall be damned.</hi> No other foundation can be laid, then the grace of God
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:180666:96"/>in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. And we cannot ſee this foundation, that wee may be built upon it, but by beleiving. <hi>Moſes by faith ſaw him that was inviſible. Abraham</hi> by faith <hi>ſaw</hi> the <hi>day</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>and was glad.</hi> As by the eye of the body wee ſee materiall objects; ſo by the eye of faith, wee ſee ſpirituall objects. The Philoſopher ſaith, that prudence is (<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Sun was not changed when the blinde man in the Goſpel, that never ſaw before, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his ſight, and beheld it. It was the ſame before, and after his blindneſſe: ſo Jeſus Chriſt, the Sun of righteouſneſſe, is the <hi>ſame: yeſterday and to day and for ever</hi> in himſelf, and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his love, in reference unto us. The change is onely in us by faith, whom now we ſee, though formerly wee beheld not his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and becauſe the righteouſneſſe and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God is revealed by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. therefore wee are ſaved by faith.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, wee are ſaved by grace, through a worke of beleeving: becauſe if it were not onely in an act of beleeving, the people of God could not have that firme, conſtant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable aſſurance of their ſalvation
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:180666:96"/>which now they enjoy in a way of beleeving. When a man is to goe unto a place by many ſeverall wayes, which are not found out, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome difficulty, he doth often doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is in the right way, or whether hee is out of his way; but when he is to goe in one plaine way, he is confident that he is not out of his way: So when a man goeth by the way of the Law, and workes for juſtification, he is in doubt, whether he is in his right way for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the Law pointing out many wayes, and requiring many duties of him, that would be juſtified under it, but the Goſpel pointeth onely at Chriſt, and faith in him, for juſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that thoſe who walke in this way for juſtification, are confident that they are in the right way. The Apoſtle doth lay downe this plainly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. where he ſaith, <hi>it is by grace, and that by faith, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed, not to that onely which is of the Law, but to that that is of the faith of Abraham, the Father of us all.</hi> God hath not made the promiſe of ſalvation to the ſeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, or that doe any workes of the Law: But he hath made the promiſe to be gracious to poore ſinners, in beleeving without the workes of the Law, to the end the promiſe might be ſure. If there had been any thing elſe required beſide faith, the ſoule would be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:180666:97"/>alwayes reſtleſſe and unſatisfied. If God ſhould tie juſtification to workes, men would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, becauſe they would doubt whether ſome workes were not undone, and then they would doubt of their juſtification; Therefore God hath not promiſed juſtification to any man, who doth good workes, or ſubmitts to any outward Ordinance, but onely unto him who cloſeth with his grace, in a pure act of beleeving. For God knowes, that, ſo long as there is any thing joyned with faith for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, wee ſhall be ready to queſtion our juſtification: wee may obſerve that ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors who are not acquainted with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, are unſetled in their ſpirits, when they doubt which is the true Government, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Ordinances of the Lord Jeſus. If they doubt whether they are baptized in a right way, or manner, they doubt whether they are juſtified; their comforts and aſſurance doe vaniſh away, when they are not fully aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they know, and are obedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Commandements of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of this legallneſſe in their ſpirits is, becauſe they doe not ſee ſalvation firmly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon him that beleeveth. The ſpirituall man beholdeth juſtifing grace in beleeving, without his obedience to commands for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:180666:97"/>worſhip, and good workes: and doth live joyfully and comfortably in the ſight of his juſtification, though he knoweth that it is poſſible, that he may be ignorant of many things; which other Chriſtians may have the knowledge of. And in theſe dayes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, contention, confuſion, and diſorder, what man can have ſolid, and laſting joy, who is ignorant of free grace for juſtification? If it were neceſſary to the aſſurance of juſtification, to know whether the <hi>Epiſcopall, Presbyteriall,</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi> Government, were the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Lord Jeſus? whether ſprinckling of Children, or dipping of profeſſing beleevers, were the inſtitution of Chriſt, in the Labyrinth of the controverſies of our times? how few would attaine to an aſſurance of their juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? How would poore creatures be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, and diſquieted in their conſciences? not certainly knowing in which of theſe wayes they ſhould walke for their juſtification and ſalvation. But that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. to thoſe, who lived in the times of the Law, as well as to thoſe, who live in theſe times of the Goſpel, ſalvation is promiſed not to workers, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, to all true beleevers in all ages, and places, to us who live in the time of the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh</hi>-Apoſtacy, as well as to thoſe who were
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:180666:98"/>hearers of the Apoſtles, and Members of thoſe Congregations which were gathered and governed by them.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, By faith the grace of God in Chriſt, is applyed unto us, and we are juſtified by it, as the ſpirituall inſtrument, formed by God in the Spirit, for the application of Chriſts benefits to our conſciences. A man that lived in the time of the Law, looking upon the blood of his ſacrifices, did behold himſelfe purged, purified, and ſanctified in his fleſh by it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13. So a ſinner looking upon the blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is applyed unto him, and his conſcience is <hi>purged from dead workes, to ſerve the living God. ver.</hi> 14. Faith though it be called a worke 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.11. (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,) yet wee are not juſtified by it, as it is a worke, or gracious quality, but as it is the hand of the Spirit, by which wee receive, and are made partakers of thoſe treaſures of grace, which are freely given unto us in Chriſt Jeſus. Chriſt bath already done, what is to be done by way of ſatisfaction to the juſtice of his Father, and hath already, <hi>made peace by the blood of his Croſſe</hi> Col. 1.20. what he doth in us now, is to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our conſciences concerning our full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by him, that you in beleeving may be filled with peace of Conſcience; being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that wee are of the Father in the Son,

                  <hi>who</hi> by the Father <hi>is made unto us, wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. Faith being nothing but a light, comming from God &amp; Chriſt, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and Chriſt to our ſpirits, and uniting our ſpirits to God in Chriſt. By faith we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve what is recorded concerning the grace of God in Chriſt; As the Prophet, to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion holdeth it forth, in thoſe expreſſions of his <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath beleeved our report? and to whom is the arme of the Lord revealed?</hi> In the latter part of theſe words, the Prophet doth interpret the former part, he beleeveth <hi>the report</hi> of God, to whom <hi>the arme of God,</hi> that is, his Sonne Jeſus, <hi>is revealed:</hi> And when a man beleeveth in Chriſt, Chriſt is revealed to that man; Faith being the firſt thing that is wrought in the ſpirit of a man, whom God doth juſtifie in his owne conſcience, by which the grace of God in Chriſt, is revealed unto him for his juſtification: Juſtifying faith, when it is wrought by the powerfull operation of the Spirit in the heart, doth remove prevailing doubts concerning our juſtification; the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beholding the all-righteouſneſſe of free grace, &amp; applying to his conſcience the clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vertue of the blood of the Lord Jeſus.

He is confident that God is faithful, who hath made this promiſe to the children of men; and by beleeving the great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes of grace, he is <hi>made partaker of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>By an heart of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe, wee depart from the living God,</hi> Heb. 3.12. but by faith wee draw neere to God, and apply Chriſt to our ſelves, (Faith being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to unbeleife, as in the nature of it, ſo in its operations) An unbeleever doth not give credit to the truth of the generall promiſes of Gods grace, and ſo remaineth unjuſtified in his conſcience; A beleever <hi>in faith, nothing wavering</hi> James 1.6. doth give credit to what is reported.

Faith doth aſſure, but it doth not onely aſſure us of Chriſt, but doth apply Chriſt, and makes a difference between aſſurance and application, which I illuſtrate by this ſimilitude. Suppoſe one ſhould lye in Priſon for debt, his debts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paid and he not knowing it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards knowing that his debts were paid, hee ſhould rejoyce in the newes and enjoy his liberty: this man doth not by the newes, which he heareth, enjoy only comfort, but his liberty: ſo it is with us, before we beleeve, we lie in priſon, and yet our debts are paid by Ieſus Chriſt, when the newes is brought by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to the eare of the ſoule, wee rejoyce in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the newes, but beſides this preſently wee enjoy our liberty, and all thoſe riches which

We are ſaved by faith. which is ſo to be underſtood, that by the miſ-vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it, wee may not detract from the glory of Gods grace, and from that everlaſting righteouſneſſe which we have in Ieſus Chriſt, who is <hi>Jehovah our righteouſneſſe. Ier.</hi> 23.6. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham when he beleeved, and his faith was counted unto him for righteouſneſſe, had a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, and his word did inwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare unto him Gen. 15.1. and he beheld God as his ſhield and exceeding great reward, and ſupreme righteouſneſſe; ſo a beleeving man doth ſo looke upon faith, as his righteouſneſſe that he doth then behold God in Chriſt, as his ſupreme righteouſneſſe, for his juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.25.1 Cor: 1.30. As <hi>Adam</hi> when hee was Juſtified by his righteouſneſſe, and true holineſſe, did ſo looke upon his owne righteouſneſſe for juſtification, that hee did at the ſame time, behold God as his chiefe good and righteouſneſſe: ſo a beleeving man doth ſo looke upon faith as his righteouſneſſe,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:180666:100"/>by which hee is ſaved, that hee doth at the ſame time, behold God in Chriſt as his cheife righteouſneſſe: Though hee acknowledgeth faith his righteouſneſſe in its place, yet he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth it as nothing in compariſon of that righteouſneſſe which hee hath in God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt; And ſaith with the pſalmiſt, Pſal. 71.16. <hi>I will goe in the ſtrength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteouſneſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of thine onely.</hi> Hee doth not by this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the righteouſneſſe of faith, hee prizeth it above the world and all things in it; which carnall men doe value at ſo high a rate. But according to the minde of him whoſe gift faith is, hee ſets the giſt in his heart, and eſteeme belowe him, who is the giver of it. Hee ſeeth ſalvation to bee more from the giver of faith, then faith it ſelfe. Hee looketh upon faith, not as the cauſe of juſtifiing grace, but looketh upon juſtifiing grace through Chriſt, as the cauſe of that faith by which he is juſtified and ſaved; And doth know, that his juificaticaon is perfected by grace, and in the perſon of the Lord Jeſus, before it is completed and effected in him by faith. Hee well underſtandeth that Chriſt and the ſoule are betrothed by faith, and yet he is not ignorant that he is <hi>betrothed</hi> to God <hi>for ever, in righteouſneſſe, and in loving kindneſſe, and in mercy.</hi> Hoſea 2.19. He is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:180666:101"/>to ſee a reconciliation by grace in the perſon of Chriſt before God, before his recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation by faith in his ſpirit. He conſidereth that <hi>when he was an enemie, he was reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> Rom: 5.10. Which reconciliation was before his faith, and yet denyeth not reconciliation by faith. He kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that what he beleeveth concerning Gods grace and his redemption, and juſtification by the blood of Chriſt was true before hee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, and yet hee beleeveth that faith is his righteouſneſſe for juſtification. Hee confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not the righteouſneſſe of faith, with the righteouſnes of God in Chriſt, by whom he is juſtified. But giveth unto God &amp; Chriſt what is to be attributed to God &amp; Chriſt, for juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; &amp; likewiſe attributeth to faith what is due to faith: not looking up o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith as his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes without the object of it, but alwayes looketh upon faith for his juſtification, as it hath reference &amp; relation to its object; which is the favour of God in Jeſus Chriſt. And if he ſhall be asked, whether hee bee more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous by grace and Chriſt, or by faith? He will acknowledge, that hee is rather juſtified by grace, and <hi>the blood of Chriſt.</hi> Ro. 5.19; Seeing more righteouſneſſe for him, in the object of faith, then in faith, by which he beholdeth the object, and yet ſtill maintaineth that faith is
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:180666:101"/>his righteouſneſſe for juſtification, according to the mind of the Apoſtle, <hi>We are ſaved by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eightly, We are ſaved by faith, not for the purity, and holyneſſe of it, as it is a gift of the ſanctifiing ſpirit. For then, upon the ſame ground, we ſhould take in <hi>Love,</hi> and other fruits of the ſpirit, which the Apoſtle doth ſhut out, as having no influence upon us, for our juſtification. which the Apohle doth prove in the following words, where he ſaith that <hi>we are ſaved, not of workes;</hi> Becauſe we are Gods workemanſhip, <hi>created to good workes</hi> Good workes are not the cauſes of our new creation, and juſtification, but the conſequents of our new creation through faith; So that it is clear, that we are juſtified before ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is wrought in us, or good workes done by us. We are juſtified by faith without them. By w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it is evident, that faith, as an holy gift or quality, doth not ſave us. We are ſaved ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by faith, as that righteouſneſſe by which we do at the firſt lay hold upon his grace in his Son for juſtification, by which wee are united unto God, and <hi>are made one with him.</hi> Ioh. 17.21. are <hi>puryfied from the guilt of ſinne</hi> in our hearts. Act. 15.9; And have peace with him through our Lord Ieſus. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. Whom we ſee &amp; imbrace by faith, as the Apoſtle ſetteh
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:180666:102"/>forth the nature of faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.13. And <hi>he that</hi> thus <hi>beleeveth, ſhall be ſaved, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not ſhall be damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly, We are ſaved by faith; Becauſe by faith we are not onely enabled to beleeve the generall truth of the goſpell, concerning his grace to thoſe who beleeve in him; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe through faith we are enabled, to give credit to Gods truth, and to reſt upon it, in reference and relation to our ſelves: Thus <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> who for the excellency and exampla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe of his faith, is worthily ſtiled <hi>the father of the faithfull, did beleeve what God did ſpeake unto him,</hi> not onely as a truth which might be beneficiall unto others, but hee looked upon Chriſt in reference to himſelfe Gen: 15. And <hi>ſaw his day, and</hi> ſeeing of it <hi>was glad:</hi> Hee looked upon God not onely as a <hi>ſhield</hi> and <hi>great reward,</hi> but his ſhield and great reward.</p>
               <p>By true faith we receive Chrſt, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits for our ſelves. <hi>Paul</hi> doth informe us, that his <hi>life</hi> in the fleſh was <hi>by faith in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who loved</hi> him <hi>and gave himſelfe for</hi> him. Faiths ſweeteneſſe doth lye in this, that by it we doe not beleeve Chriſt to be a Saviour, and righteouſneſſe, but our Saviour, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Therefore <hi>Luther</hi> affirmed that the ſweetneſſe of Chriſtianity lay in <hi>pronounes.</hi> When a man can ſay <hi>my Lord</hi> and <hi>my God,</hi> and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:180666:102"/>my bleſſed Ieſus. This was the faith which the Apoſtles preached, which will be manifeſt unto us, if we conſider their intentions, when they exhorted men to beleeve. They did not intend that their hearers ſhould beleeve in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that Chriſt was the Saviour of the world, but that hee was a Saviour to them. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the keeper of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Act. 16.31. <hi>Beleeve on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy houſe.</hi> As when they preached the doctrine of repentance (or changedneſſe of the mind) their meaning was, that every man ought to be changed; ſo when they urge beleeving for ſalvation, their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is that wee ſhould beleeve for our owne ſalvation in particular. The generall truth of faith and repentance is to beleeve, by a power enabling us in particular for our ſelves, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and repent.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We are ſaved through faith. Becauſe by faith we heare the inward word of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The word which ſoundeth to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eare, without this inward word, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth no ſalvation. As the Philoſopher told him, who reprehended him for publiſhing and divulging a booke of philoſophy, that he had publiſhed it, and he had not publiſhed it, his meaning was this, that it was ſo darke and myſticall, that though it were publiſhed, yet
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:180666:103"/>it was not publiſhed to the ignorant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned: ſo the Goſpel in the letter is publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to men, and not publiſhed; they heare, and doe not heare, they ſee and doe not ſee: But by faith wee ſo heare, that our ſoules live by hearing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>The dead,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>ſhall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God: and they that heare ſhall live: Fidei oculi ſunt ſpiritus, per quem ſpiritualia videntur, Cypr:</hi>) The Spirit is an eye to a beleeving man, by which he ſeeth, and enjoyeth ſpirituall things: wee receive not the Spirit, by hearing the Law, or doing the workes of the Law, but <hi>by the hearing of faith, Gal.</hi> 3.2. Eternall life, and Salvation is by hearing the inward word of life, ſalvation, and grace: God bids the Prophet <hi>Ezech:</hi> 38.5. <hi>to propheſie over the drie bones, that they might live:</hi> The Lord Jeſus is the great inviſible Prophet, who propheſieth over drie bones, and dead-hearted ſinners, and by hearing inwardly the inward word of this Prophet, they live in hearing, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: And therefore it is ſaid, that wee are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by faith.</p>
               <p>Having by theſe particulars, acquainted you with my Judgement, concerning our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through faith; I ſhall now by the ſame aſſiſtance of Gods grace, draw ſome uſefull concluſions, from the premiſes, and ſo put
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:180666:103"/>a period to my diſcourſe for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this doth diſcover unto us the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and excellency of the unfained faith of the elect: As <hi>Noah</hi> was preſerved from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which came upon the old world, by going for his ſafety into the Arke, ſo by the foot of faith wee walke into our Arke, Chriſt Jeſus, for the Salvation of our ſoules. The world of ſin is a diſmall <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi> full of <hi>fierie Serpents;</hi> by faith we eye Jeſus Chriſt, as our <hi>braſen Serpent,</hi> and ſet footing in the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> of gods grace, while the ſinfull <hi>Sodome</hi> of the world, is deſtroyed with the raine of <hi>fire and brimſtone;</hi> by faith like <hi>Righteous Lot,</hi> wee eſcape out of it: when with <hi>Peter,</hi> wee are readie <hi>to ſinke and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> in the Sea of ſinne, by Faith we touch the ſaving arme of the Lord Jeſus, and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, when wee drinke the deadly poyſon of ſinne; by faith we take in Jeſus Chriſt, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or antidote, and the deadly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth not hurt us; but we are miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerved. Faith beholdeth <hi>Chriſt crucified</hi> before us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. and evidently ſet forth, who hath nailed the Law of workes, our ſinne and death to his owne croſſe, and wee who deſerved damnation, are ſaved through grace. Chriſt is the man, who is <hi>an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempeſt. Iſa.</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:180666:104"/>32.2. ſin is a noxious and a deſtroying wind; as wind in the cavernes of the earth, is a cauſe of an Earth-quake; ſo ſinne is the cauſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Earthquakes in the earthly hearts of men, but Chriſt is <hi>our hiding place,</hi> in which through beleeving wee are ſafe. The Devills infernall windes and blaſtes deſtroy many a ſoule, with which he filleth it with helliſh er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and impieties to its deſtruction, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. Chriſt filleth his people, by breathing upon them in the Spirit of grace for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but Chriſt is a ſhelter from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall blaſtes of Satan: And while carnall, and unbeleeving men are, as a ſhip under ſayle, and the Devill unto them, is as a powerfull winde, violently blowing them to deſtruction, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. Chriſt by enabling his people to beleeve, doth blow them with the pleaſant gales of his ſweet ſpirit, to the havens of peace and ſafetie. Though there are infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and deſtroying windes upon earth, yet there are none in Heaven, ſo though the men of the earth, are infected with the winds of ſinne, and Satan, to their ruine; yet they who live in the Heaven of Gods grace by faith, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is a defence unto them. When darkneſſe and tempeſts are in the Spirits of men, from the Law, which they have broken, Chriſt, who <hi>rebuked the tempeſts of the Sea,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:180666:104"/>Mat.</hi> 8.2. doth rebuke <hi>(tempeſtates mentis, Hier:)</hi> the tempeſts of our troubled minds, and conſciences; and by beleeving there is a great calme in the ſoule. Sinne in the ſoule is like <hi>Jonah</hi> in the ſhip, which bringeth a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt with it, but Chriſt through faith, doth caſt this Tempeſt-raiſer into the ſea of his Fathers grace, and the ſoule is quieted, and filled with joy, and peace in beleeving. The Philoſopher ſaith, that Logick to a rationall and learned man, is the inſtrument of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) without which he ſhall make little proficiencie, in other Arts, and Sciences. So faith is the Organ, or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſpirituall man, by which hee is made partaker of the wiſdome and ſpirit of the Lord, in which he is to doe all things, and without which he can doe nothing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this diſcovers the reaſon, why the Devill and his agents doe ſo much oppoſe the Doctrine of faith, and the preaching of it. He is an enemie to mans ſalvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is an enemy to the Doctrine of faith, through which wee are ſaved. The Devill doth what hee pleaſeth to thoſe, who are without faith, as being unable to reſiſt him. Unbeleeving men are like the Iſraelites, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſhield, or Speare to defend themſelves. <hi>Jude</hi> 5.7. And the Devill doth lead them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:180666:105"/>at his will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) as wild beaſts are maſtered, and ruled by thoſe, who have taken them in a ſnare, or net, (ſo the word fignifieth) but when wee beleeve to Salvation, we are furniſhed with power to oppoſe him, who ſeeketh our damnation; when we beleeve we are armed againſt his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, and fitted againſt his oppoſition. Faith is the ſoules defenſive Shield, by wich all his <hi>fierie darts are quenched, Eph.</hi> 6.16. and therefore it is that he doth alwayes raiſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, perſecution, and reproaches againſt the Doctrine, and profeſſors of Faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing ſalvation is by faith, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy ſelfe concerning thy ſalvation, by trying thy faith. Men that are not in the faith, who have not Chriſt in them, are not approved Chriſtians. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Know yee not your owne ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except yee bee reprobates;</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, except yee be unapproved. It is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a man may be in a ſtate of unbeliefe, and yet no reprobate: But he, that cannot prove that he hath faith, cannot prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a Chriſtian; or in a ſtate of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Querie it in thy ſoule, whether thou haſt ſuch a faith, as we have ſpoken of. Yee have heard that wee are ſaved through faith, which is a ſupernaturall gift of the Spirit, by
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:180666:105"/>which thoſe things, which the naturall man cannot apprehend concerning ſalvation, are made plaine to the ſoule. Supernaturall things cannot be knowne, but by ſomething which is ſupernaturall: As the things of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are knowne by the light of nature, things of reaſon by the light of reaſon: So the things of eternall life and ſalvation, by the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall gift of faith, which is the <hi>evidence,</hi> of the ſupernaturall things of the Goſpel, <hi>which are inviſible, Heb</hi> 11.1. <hi>Abraham beleeved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hope, Rom.</hi> 4.18: So a ſpirituall man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth the things of Glory, and eternall life, which the ſhort line of naturall reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach, or fathome, and which naturally he cannot hope for, or expect. Is thy faith, who doſt Profeſſe thy ſelfe a child of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſuch a faith as <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was, who is <hi>the Father of the faithfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, true beleevers ſee their ſalvation by faith alone. Though a man have many ſeeds together in his hand, yet hee may know the various, and diverſe natures of thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſeeds: So though a juſtified man have many precious ſeeds of the Holy Spirit in his heart, yet he knoweth the ſeverall natures of them all. Though he hath love to God in his heart, as well as faith in God, yet hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the nature of Faith, which alone is avayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:180666:106"/>to Juſtification. Trie whether thou haſt been enabled to flie to the ſtrong Tower of Gods grace for ſafety, againſt Hell, ſinne, and Devills, by the ſilver wings of Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of workes for Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a beleever ſeeth juſtification can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be by grace, if workes and faith were to be conjoyned for juſtification: <hi>Gratia non eſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ullo modo, ſi non ſit gratuita omni modo.</hi>) Grace is not Grace in any way, unleſſe it be free and undeſerved; every way Grace is not free and undeſerved, unleſſe it be reached forth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration of our owne workes, which is onely through faith: trye whether God hath taught thee this leſſon of truth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, faith doth take the glory of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification from the creature, and giveth it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grace. Haſt thou learned to ſing the <hi>new ſong</hi> of the Saints, and redeemed ones <hi>before the Throne;</hi> crying, <hi>Salvation onely to God, who ſitteth upon the Throne</hi> of grace, <hi>and to the Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, art thou fully perſwaded of Gods power, and faithfulneſſe, who hath left Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of grace upon record, for the ſalvation of poore ſinners? Art thou with <hi>Abraham</hi> ſuily perſwaded of the truth of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of grace, in reference to thy ſelfe? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what one of the Ancients ſaith. That
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:180666:106"/>to profeſſe Chriſt without aſſurance, is to be without faith, living in the houſhold of faith. (<hi>Fidem in domo fidei non habere,</hi> Cypr.) A ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall man is that which he believeth himſelfe to be. <hi>(Id eſſe incipit, quod ſe eſſe credit.)</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves that he is poſitively and negatively righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in Chriſt, freed from ſinne, and made a partaker of a glorious righteouſneſſe for his juſtification; and ſo he is of a Leper, by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in an inſtant <hi>made whole.</hi> Hee believeth that he oweth nothing to his creditour, and his creditour believeth ſo too.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, A believing man is <hi>bone of the bone, fleſh of the fleſh, and one ſpirit with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> There is a cloſe &amp; neere union &amp; applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt to the ſoule by faith. Doſt thou in believing ſee thy ſelfe a member of Chriſt, as thy hand or foot is a part of thy body. Is Chriſt the quickning ſpirit of thy ſpirit? to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven that as thy ſpirit, is the ſpirit which doth enliven thy body,</p>
               <p n="7">7<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> Doſt thou ſo live by faith, that thou lookeſt upon Chriſt as thy life, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe more then faith? Not ſuffering any perſwaſion which thou calleſt thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſit in the uppermoſt roome of thy heart, to the prejudice of Gods glory in Chriſt? A ſpirituall heart is (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Mac:</hi>) the throne of the Deity, where God in Chriſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:180666:107"/>is exalted as the chiefe righteouſneſſe of the ſoule, is it ſo in thine? <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.1.</p>
               <p n="8">8<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> Haſt thou by faith as an inſtrument tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the hem of Chriſts garment, for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the bloudy iſſue of thy own ſoule? Hee that is wiſe and good, is wiſe and good for himſelfe. And if thou art truly wiſe and good, thou art wiſe in applying Chriſt to make thy ſelfe wiſe and good.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Is thy faith ſuch a faith, through which Chriſt hath inwardly diſcovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto thee, <hi>formed and created himſelfe in thee,</hi> Job 32.8? The inſpiration of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty giveth underſtanding. If thy faith be true, it is by inward inſpiration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quer.</hi> But muſt we have ſuch a faith, if wee will be the children of believing <hi>Abraham?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Every true believer hath ſuch a faith, for the nature of it, though not for the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the degrees of it: There is a perfect &amp; faire copy of faith, in thoſe who have beene preſented unto thee. Thou art to have the ſame copy written forth upon thy heart, though it may not be ſo fairly written forth at the firſt: But if it be a true copy of faith, thou haſt no cauſe to queſtion thy aſſurance, though thou doſt finde it very weake at the preſent. A palſey-ſhaken hand may receive a gift; and a weake faith may receive the grace of God in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:180666:107"/>Jeſus Chriſt. A Dwarfe is a man as well as a Giant, though not ſo tall, and one who is but a dwarfe, and low in Chriſtianity, by the weakeneſſe of his faith, may be a Chriſtian as well as thoſe who are of a taller ſtature in the Schoole of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this which hath been delivered, may be for the ſtrengthning of the faith, and the encreaſing the comforts of thoſe who have laid hold of ſalvation by a lively faith on Jeſus Chriſt. Comforts are encreaſed by the ſame meanes, by which they are wrought at the firſt. And therefore the Apoſtle prayeth for the <hi>Romans, that the Lord would fill them with all joy and peace in believing,</hi> Rom. 15.13. Our comforts are low, becauſe our faith is weake. Comfort floweth in, by renewed acts of faith. Sathan would rob us of our comfort, <hi>by wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting faith, which is our ſhield from us,</hi> Epheſ. 6.16. And this is one way in which he doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to weaken the faith of the Saints, by ſuggeſting this unto the Saints, <hi>that Salvation is not only through faith.</hi> But againſt this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and all his other fierie darts; we may hold forth this buckler of truth: <hi>That wee are ſaved by grace through faith.</hi> Anſwer him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from this truth, and he will be ſilenced; <hi>Reſiſt him in believing this trueth, and hec will flee from thee,</hi> Jam. 4.7. And the ſpirit will flie into thy ſoule to comfort thee. So long as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:180666:108"/>lived, he lived as a juſtified man by faith. So long as <hi>Paul</hi> lived, <hi>he lived by faith in the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2. <hi>We dye rather then live, when we are not under the power of the ſpirit, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling us to beleeve.</hi> We lye downe either in the bed of carnall ſecurity, or Familiſticall Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme, or fal under the bondage of the Law, when we ſtep aſide from the plaine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſalvation by faith in our Lord Jeſus. And therefore the fleſh and the Devill, the great enemies to a Saints comfort, doe joyne themſelves together to oppoſe the doctrine of faith. Sathan knoweth that faith and works are inconſiſtent in point of juſtification. And when hee obſerveth that we are in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure convinced, that ſalvation is by faith; he endeavours to perſwade us, that it is by faith and workes. And would divide our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between faith and works. As the harlet cryed out, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.26. concerning the child, <hi>Neither mine nor thine, but divide it:</hi> So the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill would have us divide our Juſtification, &amp; attribute halfe of it to faith, and give the other part to workes. But the beleeving man ſeeth that there is ſalvation in Chriſt, and not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, and that <hi>no other name under heaven is given among men whereby they muſt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 4.12. And that we reſt upon this name for ſalvation only by faith. <hi>In Chriſt we have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; acceſſe with confidence by the faith of him,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:180666:108"/>Epheſians 3.12. (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) Wee are manuduced and lead by the hand, as it were, with perſwaſion of Chriſts goodneſs to us by faith in Chriſt. Continue in that faith by which <hi>Paul</hi> was juſtified, who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Chriſt <hi>loved him, and gave himſelfe for him,</hi> and thy comforts and peace ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unto the.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which we tranſlate faith, doth moſt uſually ſignifie a firme aſſent unto a thing (<hi>uſitatiſſimum eſt</hi>

                  <hi>pro firma aſcenſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne dicere</hi>) doubting is that which <hi>is contrary to faith,</hi> Jam. 1.6. <hi>Believe therefore ſtrongly, and thou ſhalt have a ſtrong peace,</hi> Rom. 5. Beleeve that there is no remiſſion of ſinne but by Gods indulgence, but beleeve this withall, that by him thy ſins are forgiven thee (<hi>ſed adde ut cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das et hoc, quod per ipſum peccata tibi donantur.</hi> Bern.) This is the faith which bringeth peace and conſolation to the ſoule.</p>
               <p>By this we are brought from fin, to Chriſts righteouſneſſe, from mount <hi>Sanai,</hi> to mount <hi>Sion,</hi> from the dominion of the Law, to the region of grace, from bondage to liberty, from death to life, from the feare of hell, to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of heaven and happineſſe. <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> was ſo delighted in the ſtudy of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiques, that when the enemie who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the place where he lived, broke in unto it, he heard not the noyſe and ſhouting of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:180666:109"/>ſouldiers, nor the cries of the people. So the ſoule that by faith liveth in Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be carryed above the noiſe and troubles of the world, and ſhall enjoy peace in Jeſus Chriſt. Let us therefore waite in the heavenly <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> for more of the ſpirit by faith. This leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will appeare to be very neceſſary for the Saints, if wee conſider that the ſpirit of grace may be ſo quenched in Saints, that they may not for the preſent be able to goe into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God as Saints, but as poore ſinners. And by the beliefe of this Doctrine a Saint doth eaſily get out of temptation. For hee is taught of God in the Goſpell, to come unto him as a ſinner without works, when he cannot come as a Saint. And in this way his joy, with all the gifts of Gods grace are reſtored unto him. And when they are reſtored hee doth keepe them, by the reſting upon God, who ſaveth ſinners by grace through faith. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted <hi>Saints to grow in grace,</hi> doth adde, <hi>and in the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18. By which he doth ſeem to inform them that there can be no growing in grace, unleſſe there be a growing in faith, which is the knowledge of Chriſt, and the love of his Father in him.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, here is a foundation of Salvation, for all that have eares to heare,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:180666:109"/>and hearts to entertaine the report, which you have heard of Gods grace, which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to ſinners through faith. Let not any man goe away with a heart of unbeliefe: but the Lord open your eares and hearts as he did <hi>Lydia's,</hi> that you may believe what is reported: For truly if you believe what I have delivered, you may goe away rejoycing, and aſſured of Gods grace, beholding your names written in the booke of life. The true Goſpell believed will remove all objections againſt your peace, and all doubtings out of your ſpirit. If as children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ye believe as he did: Salvation will lye down in your boſomes, and the true God in Jeſus Chriſt will give you an anſwer to whatſoever you can object &amp; bring againſt your own ſalvation and juſtification. It is not the ſight of ſinne that ſhall take away your comfort: but you ſhall rejoyce <hi>that Ieſus Chriſt did dye for ſinners:</hi> It is not the want of works that ſhall ſend you away without aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or juſtification, but you ſhall ſee, that you have good right, to lay hold upon Jeſus Chriſt, though you have no works: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee juſtifies none but thoſe that have no works before juſtification. The true God is not a juſtifier of the holy and righteous, but of the ungodly. God knoweth that the wiſdome of the proud fleſh, doth ſtrongly perſwade ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:180666:110"/>to ſeeke ſalvation in themſelves, and their own works. The Jaylors queſtion, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>What ſhall I doe to be ſaved:</hi> and the Rulers quaere, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.18. <hi>What ſhall I doe to inherit eternall life;</hi> is in the heart of every naturall man, who is perſwaded that there is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. Man thinketh that as he became mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable by his evill works, that ſo hee muſt be made happy by his good works. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath given his Law which requireth perfection, to bring downe the pride of the fleſh (<hi>ad domandam Superbiam,</hi> Aug.) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in our own works; and diſcovered his free favour to the worſt of ſinners in the Goſpel. God hath blocked and ſtopped up all other ways to life, beſides the way of his grace in Chriſt: and hath left this way open for the worſt of ſinners to turne in unto it for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that as good works cannot ſave us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, (being but glittering and gilded ſins) ſo evill works cannot prejudice the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him who commeth to Jeſus Chriſt: as <hi>David</hi> in the cave <hi>Adullam,</hi> 1 Sam. 22.2. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained all ſuch who were in diſtreſſe, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and became a Captaine over them.</hi> So Jeſus Chriſt, of whom <hi>David</hi> was a type, doth entertaine all diſtreſſed conſciences, indebted ſinners, diſcontented malefactors, <hi>and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:180666:110"/>the Captaine of their Salvation,</hi> Heb. 2. He knoweth how unwilling impurity is to come to him, who is purity: what enemies we are to our owne ſalvation: what fooles we are to run to thoſe who cannot help us; like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who when he ſaw his ſickneſſe, <hi>went to the</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian <hi>who could not heale him,</hi> Hoſ. 5.13. and therefore hee publiſheth proclamations of his Fathers grace to poor helpleſſe ſinners: And bringeth ſinne-wounded miſcreants out of the wilderneſſe of ſin and miſery, to the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> of peace and holineſſe through faith in his Name. He ſeeth that we are ready to catch hold of the Law and our own works, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men who are ready to ſinke in the water, who will get hold of ruſhes or ſtrawes or any thing upon the ſurface of the water, which cannot ſave them: and therefore he reacheth forth his ſtrong arme of ſalvation for to help us, and bids us to hold faſt by him, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us of life and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Hee keepeth open Houſe, and inviteth all ſorts of ſinners so lay hold of the grace of his Father in him. <hi>He beſeecheth us to be reconciled to his Father,</hi> 1 Corinthians 5.20. He aſſureth ſinners, <hi>that whoſoever will, may drinke of the waters of life freely,</hi> Rev. 22.17. He compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe to a running River, out of which every poore Traveller may drinke freely, no
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:180666:111"/>man demanding or requiring any thing for what he takes. <hi>He doth ſet Captives ſree, not for price or reward,</hi> Iſa. 45.13. not for their works. Though wee have ſold our ſelves for nought, <hi>yet he aſſureth us that we ſhall be redeemed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money or price,</hi> Iſa. 52.3. He having paid (a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) the price or money for our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and aſſuring us now in his word of trueth, that there is ſalvation for us without our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by faith in him. Therefore let thoſe who want joy and comfort, come to the promiſes, and take Chriſt in a promiſe: ſuch who have been miſlead, and not ſet in the right way to ſalvation and juſtification; let them be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that this is the right way: be aſſured of ſalvation by grace, Chriſt dying not for the righteous, but for the ungodly: be perſwaded <hi>that Jeſus is not a Phyſician for the whole, but for the ſick,</hi> Mat. 9.12. Sin is the ſouls ſickneſs; thou art a ſinner, art ſick, and maiſt come to Chriſt not as one that is well, but as one that is ſick. Chriſt is a Chyrurgion that is able to cure the greateſt wounds: therefore he hath ſet up his bills, and bids all to come, and hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject none. Wee may with the woman in the Goſpell, ſpend all that wee have upon other Phyſicians, and be nothing profited. There is health for us, onely by comming to Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore if other Phyſitians have
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:180666:111"/>been Phyſicians of no value, while they have bid you ſeeke Juſtification and aſſurance in the ſight of your own works, and not in the ſight of Gods grace: heare this day what the Lord Chriſt ſaith to your ſoules, he profeſſeth <hi>that he calleth not the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> Hear him: <hi>Heare I ſay, and thy ſoule ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55.3.</p>
               <p>I remember that ſome Phyſitians have been highly commended that have beene able to cure their Patients ſpeedily and ſafely, and without any great torment. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is a moſt admirable Phyſitian in theſe three reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He can ſpeedily cure and heal us, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our wounds are: if there were but one wound and ſore, from the crown of the head to the ſole of the ſoote, if we were made up of nothing but ſin, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is able to cure us ſpeedily; hee is excellent in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Touch him, and the bloody iſſue of thy ſoule is immediately cured. He can ſay to thee as once he ſaid to <hi>Zacheus: This day ſalvation is come to thy ſoule.</hi> If he lay the plaiſter of his Fathers grace upon thy ſinfull ſoule, thou ſhalt be immediately cured.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt cures ſafely, there is no danger in taking that which Chriſt preſcribes. If Chriſt tell you that his Father juſtifies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:180666:112"/>ones; and that he is the Saviour of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; you may believe him, and put your life in his hand: hee will not cozen and cheate as ſome Mountebanks, that give that which kils, when they confidently promiſe health. If Chriſt promiſe to heale, he will give that phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick which ſhall effectually help us. He wil not give that unto us which ſhall hurt us. If hee had thought the doctrine of grace would have hurt men, he would never have commanded the Doctrine of grace to have beene preached. If hee had thought that the Doctrine of grace would onely have opened a doore to Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme and licentiouſneſſe, he would not have given his Apoſtles commiſſion to preach the Goſpell to every creature. Though men in their carnall apprehenſions thinke there is danger in the medicines of Chriſt. Thoſe who have had experience of him, can aſſure you that hee is a matchles Phyſitian: there is no danger in that which he gives: there is no way to ſalvation but by believing without working, Uſe this phyſicke of his, apply this plaiſter to thy ſoul, &amp; thou needeſt not to fear, whom he cures, hee cures with abundance of ſafety: I dare aſſure thee, that he will heale thee.</p>
               <p>In the third place, Phyſitians are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that cure without tormenting their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients much: and ſuch a phyſitian as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:180666:112"/>Chriſt. He comforts our hearts with Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell Cordialls while he cures us. There is ſweet comfort in the healing of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: he ſo heales thy wounds and diſeaſes, that thou ſhalt have delight and comfort while he heales thy ſoule, and gives a plaiſter to thy putrified rotten ſpirit. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth not preſcribe a tormenting reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that is worſe then the diſeaſe: but when Chriſt heales, he comforts, he ſo cures, that hee raviſheth the ſoule with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory. Wherefore come to Chriſt, you who have ſpent all, and ſuffered much; and have lain under a ſpirit of bondage 20. or 30. yeares, here is healing, looke to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; he will cure you ſpeedily and ſafely, and with delight to you. In brief: it is an eaſie and compendious way to heaven, when God gives you believing hearts, and yet the hardeſt thing in the world to believe without him: but when God ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us, the work is eaſie. When Chriſt reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to be the Phyſician, health quickly will be given in. Some affirme that generation is <hi>(in inſtanti)</hi> in a moment: It is unqueſtionable concerning ſpirituall regeneration by faith in Chriſt. Therefore looke up to the Father, and to the Son, that this work may be wrought in us. Thinke not that the worke of faith can be
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:180666:113"/>wrought by any power which is in our ſelves, it is given to us to believe by the grace of God communicated, and extended to us in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: And this is the next thing that lies in the words to be handled. <hi>Ye are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by grace through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I muſt leave that to ſome other time. In the mean while look unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lights, for it is his gift, wee cannot beſtow it upon our ſelves.</p>

               <p>When God doth effectually worke upon a
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:180666:114"/>man, to make him happy in his Son; he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth two things in a man; hee doth take him from himſelfe, and conſidence in his owne ſtrength, and doth carry him into his owne ſtrength, and goodneſſe, from whence hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth all ſtrength. And this is expreſſed here by <hi>Paul,</hi> who when he ſaith, <hi>that faith is not of our ſelves, but that it is the gift of God.</hi> I ſhall by the aſſiſtance of grace, ſpeak of the firſt of theſe, and endeavour to prove this Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That true ſaving faith is not of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>When the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> made a glorious profeſſion of the Lord, acknowledging him to be the Son of God; Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him: <hi>Bleſſed art thou</hi> Simon Bar-jona, <hi>for fleſh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father which is in heaven,</hi> Mat. 16.17. Here our Saviour beares witneſſe to the trueth of his faith: and to ſhew him that hee profeſſed not this only in word and in tongue, but that hee profeſſed it from the truth of faith which was in him: therefore hee acknowledgeth that it was not from fleſh and blood, but by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which had revealed it to him. Where we may finde our poſition clearely confirmed to you; that thoſe that truely believe, who have the unfained faith of the people of God, it is not a faith wrought in them by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it doth not flow from any naturall
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:180666:114"/>principle: but it is the immediate work of the power of God in their hearts.</p>
               <p>As wee did not, nor could not make our owne hearts: ſo wee cannot make our heart <hi>new hearts,</hi> Jerem. 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo doe good, who are accuſtomed to doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi> By which the Prophet doth clearly hold forth this truth; that ſinners can no more by their own ſtrength make themſelves ſaints, which is by faith, then a <hi>Blackmore</hi> can change the colour of his skin, or the <hi>Leopard</hi> his ſpots. An <hi>Ethiopian</hi> may be painted white, ſo an hypocriticall ſinner may bee a painted Sepulchre, appearing righteous and ſound to men, when hee is full of rottenneſſe within. But God alone doth change and purifie our hearts by his gift of faith, which is not of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>For the amplifying of this point to you. I ſhal lay down ſome ſubſequent conſiderations, by which I ſhall prove this to you; that he, that truely believes, doth not believe by any power, ſtrength, or ability in himſelfe, by which he is in any meaſure ſitted and enabled for this great work of true juſtifying faith.</p>
               <p>The firſt conſideration ſhall be drawn from the nature of faith, as it is held forth to us in the word of God, which faith is the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:180666:115"/>worke of God upon the ſpirit of a Saint, by which the grace of God in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is diſcovered to him; and by which he in his heart (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9.) is made willing to receive Chriſt, and to reſt upon him and his righteouſneſſe alone for his Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. Thus the Scripture ſpeaks of faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it ſpeakes of faith as it is a light of God in the underſtanding: ſo wee are bid to look <hi>to the Lord Jeſus, and we ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Iſa. 45.22. And it is ſaid of the faithfull, that by faith they ſaw the promiſes afar off, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. They ſaw Chriſt, not as we ſee him, who behold him as hee hath been offered up as our ſacrifice, <hi>and hath made an end of our ſins,</hi> Dan. 9. But they beheld him as one that was to come, and was to make a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation <hi>for the ſins of the world:</hi> And if wee thus look upon faith as it is a beam from God, enlightning us in our underſtandings, to ſee Gods grace in his Son; we ſhall find <hi>that faith is not of our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which will appeare if wee conſider what our owne underſtandings are, before God doth give us the true knowledge of the Lord Jeſus. I ſhall acquaint you here with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſions, which doe ſufficiently and clearly hold forth this unto us. The firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is, that men without the Lord Jeſus
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:180666:115"/>Chriſt are darkened in their underſtandings. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Gentiles that knew not Chriſt,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. <hi>That they have their underſtandings darkned, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them.</hi> There is a miſt, and cloud of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon the underſtandings of all carnall and unbelieving men. As the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> when he had ſcales before his eyes, <hi>was not able to behold the light of the Sun:</hi> ſo while the ſcales of naturall darkeneſſe and ignorance are upon the hearts and ſpirits of men, they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to behold the ſun of righteouſneſſe. They may heare Chriſt preached: they may heare the Doctrine of juſtification freely and fully handled: but they are not able to behold any thing of God or Chriſt, <hi>becauſe they have their underſtandings darkened,</hi> being not enlightned by the ſpirit of Chriſt to ſee Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. The Scripture doth not onely tell us <hi>that they are darkened in their underſtandings:</hi> but it tells us, <hi>that they ſit in darkneſſe,</hi> Matth. 4.16. <hi>The people which ſate in darkeneſſe ſaw great light.</hi> Here is the condition of all men without Chriſt ſet forth to us; <hi>they are men that ſit in darkneſſe.</hi> And <hi>Zacharias</hi> in his Song, ſpeaking of the Lord Jeſus, ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.79. <hi>That he is the day ſpring from on high, to give light to them that ſit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death.</hi> Though
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:180666:116"/>a man have eyes, yet if he ſit in a dark dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he can ſee no viſible object. It will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be evident, that carnall men cannot ſee of themſelves, becauſe they are not only darkned in their underſtandings, but they ſit in the dark dungeons of their own ſpirits, being not able to behold the inviſible things of Gods grace, which are not diſcovered and made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible unto us, untill we believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> place, the holy ſpirit ſpeaking of naturall men without Chriſt, doth not only inform us, that they are darkened, and have their ſeates in darkneſſe, but they love darknes, they are pleaſed with their preſent ſtate and condition of darkneſſe; they are unwilling to have any light break forth upon them. So our Saviour ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 3.19. <hi>This is the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that light is come into the world: but men love darkneſſe.</hi> They love unbeliefe and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: they had rather be the Devils priſoners in dungeons of darkneſſe, then enjoy their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in Chriſts marvellous light. They are ſo far from being unable to make themſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in believing, that they are in love with their owne unhappineſſe. They will not come to Chriſt, that they may have life; they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that Chriſt ſhould reign over them, though hee doth offer ſalvation unto them. They ſay unto God, <hi>depart from us, for wee will
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:180666:116"/>not have the knowledge of thy wayes,</hi> Job 21.14. Like the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> they doe deſire <hi>Jeſus</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of their Coaſts. <hi>They are the ſlaves of ſinne, and free from righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 6.20. When they are diſobedient to the commands of righteouſneſſe, they do account it their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and freedome. As the ſervice of Chriſt is liberty to a Saint (<hi>cui ſervire regnare eſt,</hi> Aug.) ſo the ſervice of ſinne is accounted liberty by a carnall man. They are like the ſervant that was to be bored through the eare, upon his profeſſion that he loved his Maſter, and would not goe out free, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.5.</p>
               <p>This is the condition of every man out of Chriſt; he profeſſeth that he loves his Maſter, he loves the Devil, &amp; the works of the fleſh, are ſweet and pleaſing to him: he had rather live as a Swine, and wallow in the filth and mire of ſinne, then taſte of thoſe joyes and pleaſures which are at Gods right hand: he had rather doe the Devills drudgery, then enjoy that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect freedome that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for the Saints. It is againſt his heart, and the whole bent, frame, ſtreame, ſtrength, and current of his ſpirit to be deſired, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and beſeeched to give entertainement to Chriſt. He is rather contented to live as a ſlave with Satan, then to rule as a King with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He is an evill tree, and cannot bring forth fruit
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:180666:117"/>to make himſelf good. (<hi>Homo extra Chriſtumeſt mala arbor,</hi> Hier.) As an evill tree cannot bring forth good fruit to make it ſelfe good, ſo an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil man, being an evill tree, all his thoughts, words and actions are evill fruits, by which he cannot make himſelfe good. He cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of himſelfe bring forth the good fruit of faith.</p>
               <p>Again, the Scripture riſeth higher in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall expreſſions, to ſet forth unto us the ſad and wofull condition of an unbelieving man. He is not only a lover of darkneſſe, and ſeated in darkneſſe: but he is darkeneſſe it ſelfe in the abſtract. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> before their converſion, ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Yee were ſometimes darkneſſe.</hi> Conſonant to which words is that ſpeech of <hi>John,</hi> John 1.5. <hi>The light ſhined in darkeneſſe:</hi> that is, in the dark hearts of unbelieving men, <hi>but the darkneſſe comprehended it not.</hi> There doth lye more in this expreſſion then in the former; It is more to be darkneſſe, then to be darkned; now wee are not only darkened in our underſtandings, but our underſtandings are nothing elſe but darkneſſe. Men without Chriſt may think that they have a great deale of knowledge &amp; wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e; but truely the holy Ghoſt tells us that all their light and underſtanding is nothing but darkneſſe; There is as much contrariety
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:180666:117"/>betweene the ſpirit of God and the ſpirit of a naturall man, as there is betweene light and darkneſſe. By reaſon of which the naturall mancannot of himſelfeobtaine the knowledg of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The carnall mind is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt God:</hi> for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither can be.

The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man receiveth not the things of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, <hi>for they are fooliſhneſſe to him.</hi> The word is very emphaticall in the <hi>Greeke</hi>

               <p>Look upon the rational man with his mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, with humane learning, Arts &amp; Sciences: with his literall knowledg of the Law &amp; Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; look upon him as he is ſublimated in his intellectualls, and as he hath made the higheſt improvement of his learning, parts, gifts, and endowments, as hee is the worlds delight for his worldly wiſedome, as he is admired by men for his prudence and eloquence; with all this, he is blinde to the all-ſeeing eye of God, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:180666:118"/>cannot receive or aprehend the glorious things of Gods grace in Jeſus Chriſt. Hee is a foole with his wiſedome, &amp; an ignorant man with his learning: a wretched ſinner with all his good works &amp; morall vertues. And no more able to open the blind eyes of his ſoule, that he may ſee the ſun of the Goſpell, which ſhineth in the ſpirits of the Saints; then a man who is borne blind, is able to give himſelf fight and bodily eyes to hehold the Sun which ſhineth in the world.</p>
               <p>He is not able by the acuteneſſe of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the ſharpeneſſe of his underſtanding, nor the largeneſſe of his parts, gifts, endowments, naturall or acquired, to attaine unto the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of things of the Goſpell: but they are meer fooliſhneſſe unto him. So that by this conſideration it will be evident, that if we looke on ſaith as it is a light in the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that then a man is not able to bring this light into his owne underſtanding: but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in his underſtanding oppoſeth the glorious light of Gods grace, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is impoſſible upon this account, for a man to beleeve of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the ſecond place if we looke on faith, not only as it is the light of God in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: but if we look on it as it is the work of God upon the will, ſo we ſhall find that we
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:180666:118"/>believe not of our ſelves; and that no man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his owne power and ſtrength, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his free will, was ever able to believe what God hath reported concerning his owne grace in his Sonne Jeſus. For as a man is darkneſſe in his underſtanding, ſo hee is nothing but rebellion in his will. As the darkneſſe in his underſtanding oppoſeth the light of Chriſt, and the beames of Goſpell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths; ſo likewiſe the ſtrength, force, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of the rebellion in his will, fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the diſcoveries, that may be made of Jeſus Chriſt to him.</p>
               <p>This is ſet forth moſt plainly to us by <hi>John, John</hi> 1.13. where ſpeaking of the Saints, he ſaith, <hi>They are borne, not of blood, nor of the will of fleſh: not of the will of man, but of God.</hi> It is not of the will of the rationall man, ſpiritually &amp; truely, to wil his owne regeneration. Let a man make the beſt uſe he can of his will; let him put forth himſelfe to the beſt reſolutions he can make; let him reſolve to doe nothing but ſeeke Chriſt, and ſtudy to know him: yet if a man be only in the ſtrength of his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, he ſhall never be able to find out the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is plaine in this point, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. <hi>It is not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth: but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> A man may have ſome weake
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:180666:119"/>reſolutions of himſelfe, and to ſeeke Chriſt, and the things of Gods Kingdom: but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee be carryed out with a higher princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and a greater power then his own wil, to Chriſt, he will never be able to effect, what he ſeemes to deſireto have effected and wrought in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In libero arbitrio nulla eſt libertas ſed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitus)</hi> Free wil is not free, but a ſlave; there is nofreedome, but ſlavery in it. It is not free to good, unleſſe it be freed from ſin by grace (<hi>ſi ſtare non potuit humana natura adhuc integra, quomedo poteſt reſurgere, jam corrupta,</hi> Bern.) If man in the ſtate of integrity, could not ſtand of himſelfe, how ſhall hee of himſelfe in his ſtate of corruption, be able to riſe now hee is fallen. Unleſſe God come downe with a mighty power and force us againſt our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall will to receive Chriſt, wee ſhall never bee made partakers of Chriſt. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>can come to mee except the Father draw him,</hi> Joh. 6.44. <hi>(Nolentes trahimur)</hi> you know when a man is drawn, he is drawn againſt his will. I need not draw a man that is willing to come after me. If we were willing to goe after God in our converſion, wee ſhould ſtand in need of no drawing: But ye ſee that God muſt compell us to come in to Jeſus, or elſe wee will never come in unto him, nor ſubmit unto his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:180666:119"/>will. I would not here be miſtaken; I do not think that when a man doth take Chriſt, that he is unwilling to take him: but hee receiveth him willingly. Yet it is not by the ſtrength of the naturall will, that a man is made willing, but by the power of grace. <hi>(Ex nolentibus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes facit)</hi> God maketh us, who are unwilling to entertaine his Sonne by nature, willing to entertaine him by grace: and the will acted by the ſtrength of ſupernaturall grace, doth act in a contrary way to it ſelfe, when it acteth in the ſtrength of corrupt nature. By which it is plainly proved, that the will of a naturall man is inſufficient of it ſelfe, to bring about the ſalvation of a naturall man. <hi>We are changed into the Image of the Lord by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. From whence one doth draw this rationall concluſion; that if we are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the ſtrength of the ſpirit, that then it is not by the ſtrength of free will. <hi>(Si a domini ſpiritu, jam non a libero arbitrio.)</hi> And we may draw the ſame concluſion from the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2.13: where he affirmeth <hi>that it is God that worketh in us both to will and to doe, of his owne good pleaſure.</hi> If God doth work in us to will what is good, then we doe not work it in our ſelves. By which it is clearely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that if faith be looked upon as a work in the will, by which it is made willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:180666:120"/>Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; that then faith cannot be looked upon as from our ſelves, <hi>but it is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond argument, for the confirmation of this may be drawn from the conſidering the diſability of men, already converted, to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good of themſelves: And thus I frame my argument.</p>
               <p>If men already converted, are not able to think a good thought, or to put forth one act of faith of themſelves; then men unconverted are not able to believe of themſelves before converſion: But men already converted are not able to think one good thought, or to put forth one act of faith of themſelves: Therefore unconverted men are not able to believe of themſelves.</p>
               <p>There is that ſtrength in the firſt propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I ſuppoſe no man pretending to bee a Schollar in the Schoole of the ſpirit, will que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the truth of it. For ſhould a man queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, he ſhould by his queſtioning of it, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute a greater ſtrength to unconverted then converted men, which is ſuch an abſurdity in Divinity, that I think no ſpiritual man would be guilty of it. And for the minor, or ſecond Propoſition, it is backed with ſuch plaine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture, that it is in vaine for any man to deny it. How plainly doth <hi>Paul</hi> deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:180666:120"/>in this point, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. Where ſpeaking of Saints, he ſaith, <hi>That wee are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves: but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> What ſpirituall act is more eaſie then to thinke a good thought? It is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to thinke well, then to ſpeake well, or doe well: we often think good thoughts, that never come out upon the tongue, or appeare in the action. Yet holy <hi>Paul</hi> is not affraid to profeſſe, <hi>that the beſt of us all cannot thinke any thing as of our ſelves.</hi> Which may be a ſufficient proof of that which followeth in the ſame propoſition, where wee ſay that he cannot put forth one act of faith. In believing our ſpirits are placed and fixed upon God, and we are filled with high thoughts of his grace in his Sonne, to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and therefore if we cannot think well, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we cannot believe well. And that wee cannot believe of our ſelves after we do believe; will be evident by the Petition of the Apoſtles, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.5. <hi>Lord encreaſe our Faith.</hi> What ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity was there, that they ſhould have prayed to their Mr. for the increaſing of their faith, if by their owne ſtrength they could have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved when they had pleaſed?</p>
               <p>And thus I have at once both proved my argument, and the point in hand, that true <hi>faith is not of our ſelves.</hi> This argument is (<hi>a majore ad minus,</hi> as we ſpeake in Logicke) from
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:180666:121"/>the greater to the leſſe: if the greater can doe nothing, the leſſe cannot; if converted men be able to do nothing toward this excellent work of faith, then unconverted men are able to doe nothing. Men who have a life in Chriſt, can do nothing of themſelves; therefore ſuch who are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes can doe nothing of themſelves, but God muſt doe all in us by his grace.</p>
               <p>The third argument may be drawne from this conſideration, that if there were any thing in the reaſon or underſtanding of man which might further him in this work of faith; then it would follow, that thoſe men who are the moſt acute men, the moſt learned men, the wiſeſt and moſt rationall men, would prove the beſt Chriſtians, and the moſt faithful men: but we finde it quite contrary. There are none commonly more ignorant of Chriſt then they who are moſt learned. The worlds wiſe-man is Gods foole.</p>
               <p>It were an eaſie matter to prove this, by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over the ſeverall ages of the world. It was the complaint of a good man long ſince. The unlearned (ſaith hee) doe ariſe and take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>um nos docti detrudimur ad gehennam)</hi> but I ſnail confine my ſelfe to Scripture. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:180666:121"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27. <hi>You ſee your calling brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called. But God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the wiſe, and the weake things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty.</hi> The wiſe men and great men of the world have not generally embraced Chriſt: but rather the worlds fools have been made wiſe by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him. The learned Phariſees did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Chriſt and his Doctrine with this, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.48. <hi>Have any of the Rulers or Phariſees beleeved on him?</hi> but this people who knoweth not the Law are curſed. They looked upon his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers as a curſed company of ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, unacquainted with the Law, which they taught for Juſtification; and ſuppoſed that the Rulers and Phariſees had ſo much wit, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and learning, that they would give no credite to his Doctrine. Therefore ſeeing thoſe who are moſt learned, wiſe, and acute by rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall parts, gifts, and abilities, are commonly moſt averſe and oppoſite to the knowledge of the Goſpell, it follows, that it is not by any thing that is in the reaſon, or underſtanding of man, by which one man is made more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of faith then any other man; but God giveth the gift of faith freely to whom hee pleaſeth.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:180666:122"/>
               <p>The fourth may be drawne from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of perſons before their converſion, as they are deſcyphered to us, and characterized forth in the word of truth. The Scripture calls them dead men; they are rather Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes then men; they have the ſhapes of living men: but they are but dead men. No more then a Carkaſſe is a man, no more is an unconverted man a man in the ſcriptures ſence. As a dead man is able to do nothing to regain life, ſo we, who are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, are able to doe nothing towards our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. This phraſe we have in the precedent words, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>You hath he quickned that were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes.</hi> And the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Coll.</hi> 2.13. That when we were dead in ſins and the uncircumciſion of our fleſh, <hi>that then God quickned us with his Son, having forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us all our treſpaſſes.</hi> A dead man heares no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſees nothing, there is no motion in him at all: ſo it is with a man that is dead in ſins, he heares not the things of grace; hee heares, but he heares not: hee ſees not the things of grace; he ſees and he ſees not: hee is not able to move one foote by faith toward heaven and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Unbelieving men are dead, if wee view them in reference to the principle of life, or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of a living man, or the operations of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:180666:122"/>life. <hi>Chriſt is the principle of life,</hi> Coloſ. 3.3. When Chriſt, who is your life, ſhall appeare, <hi>then yee alſo ſhall appeare with him in glory.</hi> They are without Chriſt, and therefore without a principle of life.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. In reference to faculties which are in living men, they are dead. Faculties are known and diſtinguiſhed by their acts &amp; operations. <hi>(Potentiae diſtinguuntur, et cognoſcuntur per a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.</hi>) And therefore wee may ſpeak of theſe two joyntly, and together. As in a living man there are faculties and operations of life; So there are faculties and operations of life in a man who is ſpiritually alive. <hi>Hee is nouriſhed,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. <hi>groweth,</hi> Pſal. 22.6. <hi>heareth, ſeeth, ſmelleth,</hi> Cant. 1.3. <hi>taſieth the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> and the like: but it is not ſo with one dead in ſin and unbeliefe: hee hath no ſpirituall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and operations of life: he lyeth rotting in the grave of ſin without theſe. If wee play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Inſtruments of Muſicke, or ſhoot off guns in his eares, he heareth it not. If God thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from ſin in the Law, or commeth from <hi>Zion</hi> with the muſicke of the Goſpell, he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it not: Refuſing to live to God by faith in Chriſt, he is dead. (<hi>Qui titi recuſat vivere mortuus eſt,</hi> Auguſt.) Men without Chriſt, take them in their beſt eſtate, and thus it is with them: with his morall embelliſhments,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:180666:123"/>and ornaments, he is but like a dead body ſtuck with flowers, or an embalmed carkaſſe. The whole world of unbelievers is but a <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or Charnel-houſe of drye bones. <hi>The man that wandreth out of the way of underſtanding, ſhall remaine in the Congregation of the dead,</hi> Pro. 2.6. Though thou art a profeſſor of Chriſt, <hi>yet without Chriſt thou art dead,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.6. The Widow that profeſſeth Chriſt, living in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is dead while ſhe liveth. As <hi>Seneca</hi> paſſing by the houſe of an Epicure, ſaid <hi>(Hic ſitus eſt)</hi> He that liveth here, is dead, and buryed here. So we may ſay of all prophane men, ignorant men, civilized men without Chriſt, formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed profeſſors, they are there dead where they live. And being dead, who will ſo far lay aſide his reaſon, to affirme, that they are able to quicken themſelves to a ſpirituall life.</p>
               <p>Againe as the Scripture ſets them out to us as dead men; ſo the Scripture preſents them to us as men that are in a ſleep. Wee have this expreſſion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light.</hi> The knowledge that a man hath of Jeſus Chriſt before his converſion, it is rather as the dreame and fancy of a ſleeping man, then the true knowledge of a waking man. A man may dream he is a King, &amp; thinkes that he hath all the riches in the world: but when he
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:180666:123"/>awakes he hath nothing, becauſe he did but dreame that hee was rich. So it is with men that have a knowledge of Chriſt, but not wrought in their hearts by the operation of the ſpirit; they may be in a dreame, and have falſe perſwaſions that Chriſt is theirs, &amp; that heaven is theirs, with all the glorious things of eternity: but they are but beggars and poor ſlaves all the while. They are likewiſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to mad men, who may think that they are Monarchs, and in a Palace, when they are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable creatures chained in a Bedlam. So car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men may have falſe perſwaſions concerning their happineſſe: but true faith is only wrought by the ſpirit of truth. And as men out of their wits cannot reſtore to themſelves the uſe of reaſon, ſo men ſpiritually mad cannot bring themſelves to the light of grace. By w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioons it is plain <hi>that faith is not of our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My laſt argument to prove that true faith is not of our ſelves, is derived from the Word, in which it doth acquaint us with the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and deceitfulneſſe of mans naturall heart. Our hearts are deceitfull and hypocriticall, and therfore unfeigned faith cannot come from them, and no credite is to be given to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of them: our ſpirits they will deceive us, therefore we are not to give any credite to any perſwaſion that comes from them; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:180666:124"/>that is a perſwaſion meerely of our owne ſpirit, is not a true faith or perſwaſion. Who will believe a common cheater, cozener, lyar, or impoſtor, that cares not what he ſaith or ſpeaks. The heart naturally is like unto ſuch an impoſtor or deceiver, according to that of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Ier. 17.9. <hi>The heart is deceitfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it.</hi> That faith therefore cannot be true which proceedeth from a naturall heart; and that comfort cannot be ſound which ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from ſuch a faith. By which, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding arguments, it doth appeare, that the true faith of the Goſpell is not of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Give mee leave now in a few words to make ſome deductions from this, and ſo I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend what I have delivered, and you to the bleſſing of she Almighty.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, this may confute the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Papiſts, Arminians, and Popiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, that conceive that a man is able to do ſomething to the furtherance of his owne ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and ſalvation. This that hath been delivered being ſeriouſly weighed in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is ſufficient to overthrow this lying Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which would attribute any thing to man, or to the ſtrength, wiſdome, underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, will or affections of the naturall man, in point of converſion, juſtification, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all renovation.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:180666:124"/>
               <p>One of the Ancients, who was more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the ſpirit then any of his fellowes, for the beholding of the truth of GODS grace, doth as boldly, as truly aſſert, that whoſoever ſhall pull downe the Doctrine of free grace, by exalting mans free will, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with an haereticall ſpirit, (<hi>Haeretico fallitur ſpiritu.</hi> Aug.) And who will ſuffer himſelfe to be ſo farre blinded, as not to ſee that magnifiers of free-will doe overthrow the Doctrine of Gods grace and mercy, which <hi>Paul</hi> preached; when they ſhall hear him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluding againſt all the free willers in the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. <hi>That it is not in him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> The free grace and mercy which the Scripture acquainteth us with, is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with mans free will to doe good of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. As <hi>Dagon</hi> was tumbled down, when the Arke, which was a type of Chriſt, and Gods grace in him, was brought into the place where <hi>Dagon</hi> was ſet up; ſo when Gods grace by the power of the ſpirit appeareth, it tumbleth downe, and overthroweth the dagoniſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, &amp; Idolatrous apprehenſions, which men have of the ſtrength which is of themſelves, to make themſelves happy. The ſpirits of men truly perſwaded of the ſtrength of grace, and their owne weakeneſſe, diſclaime their owne
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:180666:125"/>ſtrength, and ſelfe-confidences, for the making of themſelves good. And crye out with thoſe in the Prophet, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Turne thou us unto thee O Lord, and we ſhall be turned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that theſe men may not ſay that wee deale unjuſtly with them in condemning them and not hearing what they can ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; let us heare what they doe uſually thinke for themſelves, that ſo their mouths may be ſtopped by the truth of God. And thus light may ſhine more gloriouſly by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling thoſe miſts, foggs, and clouds of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which would darken it.</p>
               <p>The Scripture that ſome of them object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this truth, is, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. <hi>The ſpirit and the Bride ſay, come. And let him that heareth, ſay, come. And let him that is a thirſt come. And whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</hi> From whence they conclude, that there is a power in free will to take Chriſt, and that if a man will he may <hi>take the water of life freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I thus anſwer, that they draw more from the words, then the words do hold forth: The words ſay, <hi>whoſoever will, may take the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life freely:</hi> but the word doth not tell us, that any man is able to will this of himſelfe. It is true, <hi>whoſoever will may take the water of life freely:</hi> but it is as true, that a man of himſelfe is not willing. God alone enabling us to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:180666:125"/>to take this <hi>water of life freely,</hi> Phil. 2.13. And thus yee ſee, that if this argument be well weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary, it will be found too light to prove that for which it is alleadged.</p>
               <p>But they are ready to reply againe, and to demand of us the reaſon why God doth finde fault with men for unbeliefe, reproving them for not comming unto Chriſt, if they are not able of themſelves to believe, and come to Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why ſhould theſe men thus cavil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the goodneſſe of God? May not God with good reaſon, and without offence, inform us of our ſinne, though we are not able of our ſelves to forſake it; It is a concluſion ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irrationall, to ſay that we have power to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our fault, becauſe God doth reprove us for our fault. In theſe reproofes and the like, God ſheweth unto us his goodneſſe, in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us for our conviction; he doth not inform us of our ability, ſavingly to believe for our converſion.</p>
               <p>But me-thinkes I ſee them returning upon us againe, and making a new aſſault by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument, with which they thus oppoſe us, or rather the truth and power of Gods grace. Why doth God command, entreat, &amp; beſeech the creature to beleeve, if the creature
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:180666:126"/>have no power of himſelfe to beleeve?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Paſſages to this purpoſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> wee fiind in Scripture, do acquaint us with Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the creature in his revealed will, and the creatures duty towards God; they do not acquaint us with the ſecret, effectuall, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectable, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.19. will of God concerning the ſalvation of a creature, nor of the creatures power in himſelfe, to believe of himſelfe. The concluſions of theſe men from ſuch precepts, exhortations, and entreaties, are very abſurd and irrationall; If wee ſhall ſeriouſly weigh them in the ſcales of right and ſanctified rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. God ſay they, doth command, exhort, and entreat men to believe, therefore men are able of themſelves, by ſome power in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to believe. May they not upon as good grounds conclude that a carnall man may ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the whole Law, and be ſaved by doing of the Law, ſeeing hee is commanded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to fulfill the whole Law, and exhorted, and intreated to doe it. I ſhall ſhut up this uſe with a ſweet ſpeech of a devout and ſpirituall man; ſeeing man without the grace of God could not keep that ſalvation which hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, how ſhall he be able without grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that ſalvation which he hath loſt. <hi>(Cum igitur ſine gratiâ dei ſalutem non poſſet Cuſtodire quam accepit, quomodo ſine gratiâ dei poteſt repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:180666:126"/>quam perdidit.</hi> Aug. in Epiſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may be for the convincing of men of their diſability to will their own juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation. What God accounts wiſdome, that when man lookes on it by the eye of reaſon, he acccounts it nothing but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and madneſſe. How can a man be deſirous of Chriſt, who apprehends that the things of Chriſt are nothing but fooliſhneſſe? A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Pope ſporting himſelfe, and rejoycing in the great riches he had gotten by profeſſing the Goſpell in a carnall way, uttered theſe words; What great riches have wee gotten to our ſelves by this fable of Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>(Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus divitias lucrati ſumus ex hac fabulâ Chriſti.)</hi> So men that are not enlightned by the ſpirit of truth, to behold the world of truth, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alve the truths which men preach concerning Chriſt are meere fancies, fables, madneſſe and that fooliſhneſſe; and that there is no truth at all in which is ſpoken in the word of truth.</p>
               <p>I will inſtance but in one or two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to ſhew you how carnall reaſon oppoſeth grace. Grace telleth us, that <hi>God will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> Rom. 9.18. Conſider how car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſon oppoſeth this truth of God; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſaith carnall reaſon, that a King would hate ſome of his Subjects, becauſe hee would
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:180666:127"/>hate them, and love others, becauſe he would love them, and ſhould give no other reaſon of his actions, but his owne will: were not ſuch a King more fit to live among beaſts, then to reigne over men. And ſhall wee then thinke that the wiſe God doth love and elect ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will love them, and hate and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate others, becauſe he will hate them. Thus carnall men meaſuring the actions of God by the rule of their own reaſon, they ſee nothing but folly and madneſſe in that, by which God diſcovers his greateſt wiſdome to thoſe that are enlightned to behold the riches of his grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God in Chriſt doth preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as having a ſufficiency of grace for the ſalvation of the greateſt of ſinners without workes: but how doth carnall reaſon ſtrongly and vigorouſly fight againſt Gods goodneſſe, concluding that if there were any truth in this Doctrine, that the law and good workes would preſenly be deſtroyed. A natural man cannot believe that God is ſo gracious as Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Miniſters would perſwade the world that he is. As the unbelieving Lord, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet told him of the great plenty in <hi>Samaria,</hi> ſaid, <hi>If God ſhould open windowes in Heaven could this this thing be?</hi> 1 King. 7. So a naturall man, when Chriſt is offered to ſinners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any works (unleſſe God give grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve)
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:180666:127"/>hee is ready to ſay, If the windowes of Heaven were opened, and all the grace and mercie in Heaven ſhould come downe upon us, if God ſhould let out all the bowells of his pitty and compaſſion to poore ſinners, it cannot be ſo as you ſay, and ſpeak concerning free grace to ſinners, and ungodly ones. So that if a naturall man ſhould do nothing, but heare Sermons, and although Angells or Chriſt himſelfe ſhould come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to preach unto him, hee would be as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of himſelfe to keepe the whole Law for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as to beleeve truly and ſavingly in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, that if it be thus that a man may as eaſily in his owne ſtrength, keepe the Law as beleeve the Goſpell; why doth not God then rather enable us to keepe the Law that wee may be ſaved, then bid us to beleeve the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; that God ſaves us, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabling us to beleeve the Goſpel, and not by enabling us to keepe the Law for Juſtification, becauſe God will have the glory of his grace in our Salvation. God will not ſave us in a way of working, but in a way of beleeving, that all the glory may be given to him. The Apoſtle gives this as a reaſon, <hi>why it is by faith and not by workes, that no man might boaſt,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>Not of workes, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> By
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:180666:128"/>which argument he proveth that the Father <hi>of the faithfull was not juſtified by workes,</hi> Rom. 4.2. If <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtified by workes (ſaith hee) <hi>he hath whereof to glory.</hi> As we may obſerve it in ſome people, who are built upon legal principles like the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. They are boaſting, <hi>that they are not as other men,</hi> as though their good workes had made the difference betweene them and others. This frame of ſpirit doth rob God of the glory of his grace, who will not that any fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence: but that <hi>he that glorieth ſhould glory in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.29.3. <hi>And therefore wee are ſaved by grace through faith in the word made fleſh, and not by the workes of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, ſome will object, why doth God take this paines with men in the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Word? if they are able to doe no more to their owne converſion, then a dead man to his owne reſurrection.</p>
               <p>To this objection I have already given an anſwer, yet give me leave to adde this to what hath been already ſpoken, for the fuller ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe that are weak. Though we are able to doe nothing of our ſelves, yet God entreates, exhorts, and beſeecheth us to be reconciled to him in Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe in exhorting, intreating, and beſeeching of us to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:180666:128"/>beleeve, he puts forth his power and his owne ſtrength to enable us to beleeve; while <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted the Gaoler <hi>to believe in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus that hee might be ſaved,</hi> God enabled the Gaoler to beleeve. Life and power is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſoule in Goſpel commands and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations. When <hi>Chriſt raiſed the ſonne of the Widow of</hi> Naim <hi>to life, Luke</hi> 7.14. he ſpeakes to him; <hi>Young man I ſay to thee, ariſe.</hi> No man who hath not loſt his reaſon, will conclude from hence, that it was by the power of the young man that was dead, by which hee was raiſed from the dead, but by the power of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>who did bid him ariſe.</hi> So, though God ſpeak in the Miniſtry of the word to thoſe <hi>that are dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes,</hi> and bids <hi>them ariſe from the dead that hee may give them light;</hi> yet we cannot conclude from thence, that it is by the power of men by which they doe believe: but it is by the power of the ſpirit conveyed in the preaching of the Word. Chriſt commanded <hi>Lazarus to come forth,</hi> but he came not forth in his owne ſtrength, but in the power and ſtrength of him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him out of the grave; So wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand men to come forth out of the grave of ſinne: but they come not forth in their owne ſtrength, but in the power and ſtrength of that ſpirit that commands them from the grave
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:180666:129"/>of ſinne to the land of the living. While <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi> propheſied over the dead bones, <hi>breath came into them, and they lived,</hi> Ezek. 37.10. So while the Prophets of the Lord do preach over their ſinfull impenitent hearers, who are like the Prophets drye bones; the breath of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the ſpirit of the moſt High in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpell, enters in into them, and not by working, but believing they are made new creatures, and ſee the Kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>In the next place, you ſee <hi>faith is not of our ſelves,</hi> it is not in any thing in man, or in mans wiſdome that man is enabled to believe what is reported concerning Gods grace in Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore this may convince us that that faith which is of our ſelves is a falſe faith, and not the true juſtifying faith of the Saints. The good fruit of faith cannot grow out of a wicked heart. And the heart of a man naturally, <hi>is wickedneſſe, and every imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the thoughts of his heart is vanity, and only evill continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5. Pſalm. 94.11. When God lookes downe from Heaven upon the children of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> hee ſeeth <hi>that there are not any that doe underſtand and ſeek God. They are all gone aſide, they are all become filthy, there is none that doth good, no not one,</hi> Pſal. 14.2.3. <hi>And the Lord Jeſus dyed for us when wee were enemies unto him, and without ſtrength to do
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:180666:129"/>any thing for our owne ſalvation,</hi> Rom. 5.6. That faith therefore which is wrought by the ſtrength of nature, is not that true faith of the Goſpel which is only wrought by the ſpirit of the Goſpel. According to that of the Apoſtle, where he affirmeth, that the <hi>Saints are juſtified by the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11. Therefore if thy faith be a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or perſwaſion of thine own ſpirit; If it be framed and hammered by thy ſelfe upon the anvile of thy owne ſpirit, it is a counterfet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and will not be able to advantage thee in the great day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>As wee read in the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> of the viſions of a mans owne heart, and the viſions of God. So there is a two-fold faith; there is the faith or perſwaſion of a mans own heart, and a perſwaſion of the Spirit of God. And as the viſions of a mans owne heart are falſe dreames, lies and deceits, and are juſtly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the Prophet, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23.26. So the perſwaſions of a mans owne heart, they are falſe dreames and lying perſwaſions, we are to give no credite to them. As we ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a common lyer: So we are not to believe the perſwaſions of our own hearts.</p>
               <p>The ſame Prophet in the 28. <hi>ver.</hi> compareth lying Propheſies to chaffe, and the Propheſies of truth to wheat, what (ſaith he) is the chaffe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:180666:130"/>to the wheat. So true faith is like unto wheat, and faith of our ſelves is like unto chaffe. <hi>As the winde driveth away the chaffe,</hi> Pſalm 1.4. So the blaſts of Gods wrath, and the winds of temptation will blow away the chaff of a falſe faith, while true faith ſhall be preſerved by God, and we through it ſhall be preſerved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the day of redemption.</p>
               <p>Wherefore brethren, we are to try whether or no we doe truly believe. <hi>Examine your ſelves</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Whether ye bee in the Faith.</hi> As we have a touch-ſtone to trye gold, ſo God hath left a ſpirituall touch-ſtone by which true faith may be tryed. As there are counterfet pieces of gold, which can bee hardly diſtinguiſhed from true gold, until they are brought to the touch-ſtone; ſo there is a counterfeit faith, which can hardly be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from true faith, untill it be brought unto the ſpiritual touch-ſtone. Therefore it will be the wiſedome of every one of you, to try what faith you have. It is not enough to be perſwaded that you ſhall be ſaved, and that Chriſt is yours, and that your names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in heaven. Alas, there are falſe perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as well as true. There are multitudes of Libertines, who <hi>turne the grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, and make their bellies their Gods, and minde earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3. <hi>And yet have</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:180666:130"/>ſtrong perſwaſions that they are in the grace and favour of God. There are Phariſees who are perſwaded that they are in the love of God the Phariſee had an aſſurance, and gave God thankes for it too, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. <hi>God I thanke thee I am not as other men are.</hi> And yet hee was but an hypocrite all the while, deluded with the proud conceits of his owne righteouſneſſe. The unbelieving Jewes profeſſed with a great deale of boldneſſe and confidence that God was their Father, <hi>John</hi> 8.41. <hi>We have one Father, even God.</hi> And yet our Saviour tells them plainely, that though they had theſe ſtrong perſwaſions that <hi>God was their Father,</hi> yet in truth the Devill was their Father. <hi>Ye are</hi> (ſaith he) verſ. 44. <hi>of your Father the Devill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A man may be perſwaded that Chriſt will ſave him, and goe to hell and be damned with that perſwaſion.</p>
               <p>We ſee by experience, that many Apoſtates, who have made a profeſſion of Chriſt, &amp; have had ſtrong perſwaſions of the love of God, have fallen from the Goſpell to prophaneneſſe, Arminianiſme, and diabolicall Familiſme.</p>
               <p>Our bleſſed <hi>Emanuel</hi> doth plainly prove this truth unto us, by acquainting us with ſome, who, when they ſhall be brought before his judgement-ſeate, ſhall be confident of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him, whom nevertheleſſe hee will not
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:180666:131"/>own to be his, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21, 22. <hi>Not every on that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many ſhall ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name? and in thy Name have caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills? and in thy Name done many wonderfull workes?</hi> Yet you ſee what Chriſt will profeſſe unto them; <hi>I never knew you, depart from me yee workers of iniquity.</hi> As if he had ſaid, It is true, you had a ſtrong perſwaſion that you ſhould be heires in my Kingdome; it is true, you thought that you ſhould be ſaved if any in the world were ſaved, but I tell you for all that, <hi>I know you not, depart ye workers of iniquity.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerns all men to know whether their faith be a right faith. Self-iſh faith is no right faith: if it ariſe from no higher a fountaine, then our own natural reaſons, wiſdomes, and underſtandings; our faith is from our ſelves; and we may carry it to hell with us, and find as good faith there in the Devills, as this is. Though this which I have ſpoken concerning the tryall of faith, doth chiefly concerne ſuch who are deceived with a falſe faith, of their owne making: yet it will be very advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the true Saints likewiſe to try their faith. Wherefore before I preſſe this farther upon ſuch who are under a ſpirit of deluſion,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:180666:131"/>I ſhall ſpeak a word unto the Saints unto this purpoſe. Conſider that that man who hath true faith, may likewiſe have much falſe faith. There may bee a great deale of dead faith in him, who hath a living faith. Where there is true gold, there may be much droſſe; and in that Profeſſor in whom there is the golden faith of the Goſpell, there may be a great deal of droſſie faith, which is nothing worth. A Chriſtian hath two contrary natures in him. Hee hath fleſh as well as ſpirit. And as there are perſwaſions in him flowing from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo there may be perſwaſions flowing from the fleſh. Saints ſometimes, when they are in a luke-warm and back-ſliding condition, are apt to pleaſe and content themſelves with the workings and perſwaſions of their owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And they may finde that much of their joy and comfort doth not proceed from true faith wrought by the operation of God, but from the lying, cheating, counterfeit working, and operation of their owne ſpirits. Will you know one principall ground and reaſon why ſome true Saints are ſo unfruitfull, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, formall and luke-warm in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpell? it is becauſe the Devil cheats them with the workings and perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own ſpirits.</p>
               <p>When God perſwades the heart of his love, our hearts are inflamed with an holy
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:180666:132"/>love to God, and are willing to doe or ſuffer for the glory of God: but when wee content our ſelves with the working of our owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, there is idleneſſe, ſloath, neglect of Chriſtian duties, coldneſſe, formality, and lukewarmneſs; ſo that there is little difference between us &amp; others. Again it concerns you all to try your perſwaſions: For if any of you co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and cheate your ſelves with the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your owne ſpirits, the time will come that you, who kindle theſe ſparks, and walke in the light of your owne fire, and in the ſparks that ye have kindled; <hi>This ſhall ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the hand of the Lord, ye ſhall lye down in ſorrow,</hi> Iſa. 50.11.</p>
               <p>When you expect heaven, you will be caſt downe to hell; when you ſhall be confident that Chriſt is yours, and ſhall bee ready to plead the goodneſſe of your cauſe in the face of Jeſus, you ſhall finde that you were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the falſe perſwaſions and workings of your owne humane ſpirits. A faith of your ſelves, by which ye have been perſwaded of thoſe things, which ye have received by the relation of things to the eare, will not ſave you; but that faith which is wrought by the Spirit, giving an heavenly revelation of Chriſt to the heart. Therefore try whether your faith be from your owne humane ſpirits and naturall underſtandings, or whether it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:180666:132"/>from the power and ſpirit of the moſt high God mightily working in you for the ſalvation of your ſoules.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, How ſhall we be reſolved in our ſpirits that our faith hath not procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from our owne ſpirits, but that it is a work of God in us?</p>
               <p n="1">1. When God works faith, he gives an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent light by which wee ſee the truth of our faith: and thus the faithfull are in the firſt place aſſured of ſalvation in believing. <hi>The juſt doth live by faith,</hi> Heb. 2.4. and hath his life and righteouſneſſe by faith. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. The ſpeciall preſence of Chriſt in the ſoule doth make a man a new creature, and by faith the new creation in us is diſcovered unto us, and therefore Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to bee formed in us by faith,</hi> Gal. 4.19. So many as receive him by faith, <hi>are born not of fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God, and have power to be the ſons of God,</hi> 1 John 12, 13. <hi>By faith wee are the children of God,</hi> Gal. 3.26. <hi>and know that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> 1 John 5.10. <hi>Hee that believeth on the Sonne of God hath the witneſſe in himſelfe.</hi> By which words it appeareth how true faith differeth from a wavering opinion (<hi>unde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paret quantum differat à fide fluxa opinio;</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.) It is the office of faith to beare witneſſe to the certainty of our ſalvation, and to give
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:180666:133"/>in a teſtimony of our happineſſe by Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. <hi>The blood of Chriſt doth purge the conſcience from dead workes,</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>By faith we drink this blood of the Sonne of God,</hi> Iohn 6.53. and look upon him who is inviſible to the eye of reaſon, by this eye of faith <hi>which is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeene,</hi> Heb. 11.1. Chriſt is ſet forth as a propitiation and object of our juſtification by the Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. And by faith wee looke upon him who is ſet forth unto us to be looked upon. <hi>It is life eternall to know the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent,</hi> John 17.3. And true faith is nothing elſe but the true knowledge of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. (<hi>Fides quid aliud eſt quam vera de deo cognitio?</hi> Cyr.) <hi>Hee that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life, and he that believeth not ſhall not ſee life,</hi> John 3.36. In which words our Saviour doth ſeeme to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a believer, and an unbeliever. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing man ſeeth not eternall life: but the believing man ſeeth eternall life, <hi>and hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life abiding in him,</hi> by which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he is freed from the death of ſin, and from the temporall and eternall death for ſin, and ſhall not come into condemnation: For when a man truly believeth, heaven is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto him, and he hath a ſpirituall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Chriſt made unto his ſoule. But it is not ſo with a man, who hath a perſwaſion
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:180666:133"/>formed in himſelfe by himſelfe. As <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>that what hee had ſeene; hee declared unto them,</hi> 1 John 1. ſo every ſpirituall man may ſay that he hath ſeene Jeſus Chriſt. With <hi>Stephen</hi> by faith he ſeeth God, and his Son Jeſus ſtanding on his right hand. Chriſt is ſo perfectly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the eye of faith, that the believer doth by faith looke upon a crucified Chriſt, as though he were preſent before him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. The Apoſtle to prove the effectuall calling, &amp; juſtification of the Theſſalonians, doth affirm, <hi>that the Goſpell came unto them in much aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.5. Enquire now in thy owne ſpirit, whether thy faith is ſuch a faith as this, which the Scripture doth call the unfeigned faith of the elect; and if it be ſuch a faith, <hi>it is not of thy ſelfe, but it is the gift of God.</hi>

               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. <hi>The Kingdome of God being not in word, but in power,</hi> thou that doſt truly believe haſt found the word of ſalvation to come unto thee with a mighty power. This was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to <hi>Paul</hi> of the truth of the converſion of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> becauſe <hi>the Word came in power unto them,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.5.</p>
               <p>Thou that haſt truſted to a perſwaſion of the grace and favour of God to thee in Chriſt, wrought in thee by thy own ſpirit, thou haſt had no heavenly power in this perſwaſion: But he that hath faith wrought by the ſpirit
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:180666:134"/>of God, there is a mighty power of God comes downe upon him when hee is enabled to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Thou that haſt a falſe faith apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt it an eaſie thing to believe, becauſe thou didſt never feel a power from above comming upon thee to enable thee to believe.

For where there is true faith, a man feeles the power of God enabling him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the teſtimony that God gives of his Son Chriſt. I will give you a plain place to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 1.19, 20. where hee praying for them that they might ſee the mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by which they were enabled to believe, doth make uſe of many very emphaticall expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that ye may know ſaith he what is the <hi>exceeding greatneſſe of his power to us-ward who believe: according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:180666:134"/>him from the dead.</hi> There hee ſpeakes not only of a power, but the greatneſſe of power, and not only the greatneſſe of power, but the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent greatnes of his power (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) And as though hee had not ſpoken enough to ſet out the Almightineſſe of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer by which we are enabled to believe; hee doth inform us that ſuch an operation of the power of the vertue of God, (for ſo the words may be tranſlated) by which Jeſus Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, and declared to be the Sonne of God, is put forth for the enabling of us to believe. Thou that haſt not this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in thy ſoule, thy perſwaſion is wrought in thy ſpirit, not by the ſpirit of grace &amp; truth, but it flowes from thy own naturall and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſpirit; and it is a perſwaſion that will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doe thee good: it will never bring thee true comfort: A man that hath not a better perſwaſion than this, ſhall never ſee the face of God with joy.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. Faith which is not of our ſelves, doth carry us out of our ſelves. A faithful man hat his life not in himſelfe, but in Jeſus Chriſt. He liveth not by the principles of the firſt, but ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> He hath his ſpirituall being in the Father, and in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt. He is joyned to the Lord, and is one ſpirit. Hee ſeeth the Father in the Son, and the Sonne in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:180666:135"/>him, and the Father in him through his Son. According to the promiſe of our Saviour, John 14.20. <hi>Ye ſhall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſpirituall <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> affirmeth that <hi>they are in the Father, and in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.1. By faith we enjoy the glory of union. <hi>The glory which thou haſt given me, I have given them, that they be one, even as we are one,</hi> John 17. Though we have not the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of equality (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) yet we have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of likeneſſe, (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) Though we are not united to the Father to immediately as Chriſt is, by himſelfe, and in himſelfe; yet we are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to him <hi>(mediante Chriſto)</hi> by the meanes and mediation of Chriſt Jeſus. This is the honour which is given to thoſe who truſt by a lively faith, in the name of the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> Faith which is not of our ſelves, doth carry us beyond the world. A believer loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon Chriſt overcomming the world for him, doth through faith overcome the world by him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>Whatſoever is born of God, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercommeth the world: and this is the victory that overcommeth the world, even your faith.</hi> Therefore the Saints are ſaid <hi>to be cloathed with the Sun, and to have the Moon under their ſeet,</hi> Rev. 12. Becauſe being through ſaith cloathed
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:180666:135"/>with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt who is called <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſſe,</hi> Mal. 4.2. They tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon all ſublunary things as worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He that truly believeth in Chriſt, is anointed with the ſpirit of Chriſt, and aſſured of his abiding for ever in Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>The anointing which ye have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of him, abideth in you, and as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him.</hi> God ſhould loſe his earneſt if it were poſſible for us, to miſcarry to the loſing of our ſoules after wee have this earneſt from him, which bindeth him to bring us to heaven and happineſſe. This ſpirit perſwades us that we are the ſons of God, &amp; that God will loſe none of his ſons. Hee that hath this ſpirit, knoweth that no man that hath the ſpirit can ſpeake what he feeles from the work of the ſpirit of adoption in his owne heart. Hee admires grace when hee lookes on God reconciled in Chriſt to ſinners, &amp; lookes on himſelfe reconciled to God in believing; and when he feeleth the ſpirit of God witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with his ſpirit <hi>that he is the childe of God:</hi> hee can goe boldly to the Throne of grace, knowing Chriſt as his elder brother, &amp; God his Father in him.</p>
               <p>Selfe-deceiving hypocrite, doſt thou not begin to be convinced, that thy faith is not the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:180666:136"/>true faith of the Goſpell, by that which hath been ſpoken concerning this <hi>faith which is not of our ſelves, but the gift of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. As I told you even now, There is never true faith, but true love follows it. Love is an ndividual companion of faith. Therefore ſuch as have faith, andnever have love accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of it, may be confident that their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion concerning the grace and goodneſſe God in Chriſt, is but a carnal, and not a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall perſwaſion. True faith worketh by love; therefore if mine work not by love, it is a falſe faith: this is an undenyable argument.</p>
               <p>Brethren, miſtake me not in this point unto which I now am ſpeaking, miſ-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending my meaning, as if Ibid you love God, &amp; the brethren, that you may believe, &amp; be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified; no, but I tell you now that where true, lively, and juſtifying faith is, there love will follow. When we doe in the light of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit apprehend Gods love to us, and the love of Chriſt in giving himſelfe for us, wee cannot but love God againe, and love Chriſt who hath loved us, <hi>and given himſelfe for us.</hi> So that where there is no true love, there is no true faith. If it be truth, that where fire is, there will be heat: it will neceſſarily follow, that where there is no heat, there is no fire: So if where true faith is, love will follow, it will
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:180666:136"/>neceſſarily follow, that where true love doth not follow, there true faith did not precede, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. <hi>Wee love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> He that loveth not God, hath not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Gods love to him. As farre as thou believeſt in a ſpirituall way, the love of God ſhall conſtrain thee to love God. <hi>(Tantum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligimus, quantum ſcimus)</hi> love is anſwerable to the meaſure of our faith or knowledge. Hee that hath <hi>Pauls</hi> faith, ſhall have his love. We ſay that love is the load ſtone of love <hi>(magnes amoris amor.)</hi> So Gods love doth draw forth our hearts in love to God. God in Chriſt, when he is preſented unto us for our juſthifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, doth appeare to us as ſuch a lovely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that we cannot but love him. The greek proverb is, that loving is wrought by ſeeing. (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) ſo when by faith we ſee the love of God in Jeſus, wee cannot but love God. And therefore <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.8. <hi>That he that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love.</hi> Wherefore that faith, by which thou art perſwaded of the love of God to thy ſoul, which carries thee not back again in love to God. I dare ſpeak it in the preſence of God, that that perſwaſion is not wrought by the ſpirit of grace, but is the worke of thine owne carnall and naturall heart. <hi>If any man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:180666:137"/>him be Anathema Maranatha,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.22 Let him not be accounted as one <hi>(inalbo fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um)</hi> in the liſt of the faithfull. Let him be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, look not upon him as a true Chriſtian. <hi>Peter</hi> though hee had denyed Chriſt not long before, yet he was confident that he loved that Chriſt whom he had deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when Chriſt asked him, <hi>Simon, ſonne of</hi> Jonas <hi>loveſt thou me?</hi> he ſaith unto him, <hi>yea Lord thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> John 24.15. When Chriſt the ſecond and third time propoſed the ſame queſtion unto him, he remained ſtill confident of his love: And appeals to Chriſt the ſearcher of all hearts, as to one who knew the truth of his love, <hi>v.</hi> 17. Hee ſaid unto him, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> I ſhall but adde one thing more, becauſe I ſhall (God willing) have an opportunity to enlarge my ſelf in this point, when I ſhall prove unto you affirmatively, <hi>that true faith is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, where the grace of the Father in the blood of his Son, is apprehended; for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of ſin, there is a forſaking of ſin. When God doth diſcover this, that he will heale back-ſliding, love freely, and turne away his anger. <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall ſay, <hi>what have I to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more with Idols,</hi> Hoſ. 14.8. When God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth ſin by his grace, he will ſubdue ſin by
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:180666:137"/>his grace, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18, 19. That man who hath true faith wrought in his heart, he ſhall ſeele the power of grace apprehended for his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ingaging his ſpirit to deny ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2 11, 12. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation hath appeared to all men,</hi> teaching us, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ungodlineſſe and wordly luſts, <hi>we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</hi> Firſt, <gap reason="foreign">

Grace will not ſuffer us to live graceleſly, becauſe we are juſtified by grace: but will throughly acquaint us with our duty towards God, towards men, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelves. If the grace that thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeſt teach thee not to deny ungodlineſs, but thou liveſt in a graceleſſe way, diſhonouring Chriſt, diſcrediting the Goſpell by thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſcandalous, and evill life, thou doſt not in deed, and in truth apprehend the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>If God diſcovers himſelf to <hi>Abraham</hi> as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, he will <hi>command him to walke before him, and be upright,</hi> Gen. 17. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over us, if we are not under the law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6. Chriſt will preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto us as the pattern for ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if hee reveale himſelfe as the object of our
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:180666:138"/>juſtification. Every man who hath a ſure and lively hope of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth himſelfe as he is pure,</hi> 1 John 3.3. He that truly expects happineſſe hereafter, ſtudies pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity here. True Saints do deſire, not only to know, but to doe the will of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. <hi>Teach mee to doe thy will O Lord</hi> (ſaith the man after Gods own heart) thy ſpirit is good <hi>lead me into the land of uprightneſſe.</hi> The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Goſpell will not lead us into the land of prophaneneſſe, but into the land of uprightneſſe. Gods goodneſſe to us will make us in love with holineſſe. <hi>They ſhall feare and tremble for all the goodneſſe, and for all the proſperity that I procure unto them, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 33.9. The golden chaine of mercy, let down from heaven to draw us up unto God, doth binde us and oblige us to the ſervice and obedience of God.</p>
               <p>If thou art an old profeſſor of the Goſpel and doctrine of grace, and liveſt graceleſly, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſanctifying ſpirit, &amp; yet haſt a ſtrong perſwaſion that God is thy Father, and Chriſt thy Saviour: thy perſwaſion is not worth one farthing, it will doe thee no good: Where there is no deſire of purity, there is no work of true faith: for when thou haſt a true, and a lively faith, and thou ſeeſt God gracious, loving, and merciful, believe it,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:180666:138"/>thy ſpirit will be carried forth in deſires to be made like unto Chriſt in holineſſe. <hi>Wee all</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord; are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame image from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. If thou by the lively operation of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit haſt ſeene the glory, grace, beauty and holineſſe in Chriſt, for thy Juſtification, thy ſpirit will be ſo enamourd with the beauty of holineſs &amp; perfection in Chriſt, thou wilt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee the image, and picture of holineſſe, &amp; perfection which is in Chriſt, to be drawne forth upon thy own heart and ſpirit. There may bee ſome that may thinke that this is ſtrange Doctrine which I have delivered, to wit, that a man may have ſtrong perſwaſions concerning his intereſt in God and Chriſt, and boaſt much of it, and yet be but a hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite and reprobate all the while. I ſhall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adde one place of Scripture to thoſe which I have delivered for the proofe of this, and ſo for the preſent I ſhall conclude. Yes ſhall find it in <hi>Micah.</hi> 3.11. <hi>The heads judge for reward, and the Prieſts teach for hire, and the Prophets divine for money; yet for all this will they leane upon the Lord, and ſay, is not the Lord among us? none evill can come upon us.</hi> See here a baſe, vicious, and covetous people, that ſell Juſtice, and the Word of God; and yet are
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:180666:139"/>confident that they belong to God; they would not preach without money in their hand; like many of our Prieſts, no penny, no pater-noſter; no money in hand, no Sermon, no preaching, that will not open their mouths further then it is opened with a key of gold or ſilver, yet they profeſſe they are the people of God, and make a great ſhew of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and blinde the eyes of poor ignorant people that conclude they are the only zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous holy men in the world, though their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, baſeneſſe, and vileneſſe in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after Livings and great preferments, may appear evidently to children. Ye ſee by this that people may lean upon God, deſire to be accounted his people, and be confident that he is their Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. And yet may have no true faith, but may be ſelf-impoſters, deceiving themſelves with the perſwaſions of their own ſpirits, whereas true faith is onely from God, beſtowed upon us by him as a free gift, which let the good God worke in our hearts by his grace through Chriſt, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing doth lay the creature lower in the preſence of God, then a cleare appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Creators fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and goodneſſe, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things freely to the creature. The Apoſtle to beat down the pride of man in ſpirituall gifts, doth make uſe of this quaere, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>What haſt thou, that thou haſt not received.</hi> As if he had ſaid, if thou doſt but ſeriouſly conſider, that thou enjoyeſt no ſpirituall gift, but it hath been freely given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:180666:140"/>to thee, thou wilt not ſee any cauſe why thou ſhouldſt be proud of it. And in theſe words, for the humbling and abaſing of man, and for the exalting of Gods grace in Jeſus Chriſt, he doth ſet downe this in the laſt place, <hi>That true faith is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall illuſtrate this two manner of wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will ſhew you that it is the gift of Gods power: For this the Apoſtle drives at here; when he oppoſeth faith, as the gift of God, to what he had ſaid before, maintaining that it was not of our ſeves. Man being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to believe of himſelfe, it will neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it is onely the power of Almighty God, that is able to enable a man truly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his grace through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place I ſhall ſhew you, that faith is the gift of Gods grace. As God alone by his almighty power is able to enable a man to believe: ſo God alone can give us this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and precious gift of faith, by which we are made partakers of the divine nature, and carried to heaven, to behold the glory of our God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, faith is the gift of the power of God, and therefore <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.1. we read of the arm of God, which is to be put forth, for the ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of men to believe the Goſpell. <hi>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arme of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:180666:140"/>the Lord revealed.</hi> The ſtrength of a man doth uſually lye in his arme, wherefore God to ſhew <hi>that few doe believe,</hi> John 12.38. doth prove it by this, becauſe his arme or ſtrength <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s revealed to few. The arm, power, &amp; ſtrength of God muſt be put forth and revealed to men, or elſe men will never be able indeed, and in truth to believe what God hath related, and reported concerning his glorious grace in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This will appeare by ſome few conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is the prerogative of Gods powerful will to ſhew mercy, by giving faith for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to whom he will, and therefore it is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the power of ſinfull man; effectually to will his owne ſalvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his owne will he begot us.</hi> God is the God of ſalvation, and therefore the creature cannot be a Saviour to himſelfe. <hi>Save me,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>for thy mercy ſake,</hi> Pſal. 31.16. Why ſhould the Pſalmiſt have prayed unto God, to ſave him, if hee had beene able to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, by working faith in his owne heart, wee are all ſinners, ſaved by obtaining a Pſalme of mercy. And it is God that granteth us a pſalm of mercy for the ſaving of our lives, and giveth us learning, by which wee are enabled for to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ead it. The will of God is the ſupream ruler,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:180666:141"/>and governour in all things, and therefore in this, for the giving of faith unto whom hee pleaſeth, for ſalvation. Man lies under unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief many yeares, when God once comes and ſpeakes the word to command light to ſhine, then preſently we are enlightned. He created light by the word of his power, and made the heavens; ſo by the ſame omnipotent word, and power of his, he is pleaſed to create, and ſet up new light in the underſtandings of thoſe whom hee intends to ſave, giving to them the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſweetneſſe of his grace and glory in the countenance of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the gift of his irreſiſtable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. <hi>His will and power cannot be reſiſted,</hi> Rom. 9. If there were not ſuch an irreſiſtable power in grace, no man could ever be made a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of grace. All the ſtrength of the naturall man doth fight againſt grace, and taketh up armes againſt Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that if God did not work irreſiſtably, there would never bee wrought the work of grace in the heart of any man. If God will perſwade <hi>Japhet</hi> hee ſhall dwell in the tents of Shem, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27. <hi>will worke,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>and who ſhall let it,</hi> Iſa 43.13. That is, none ſhall let it. All the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in hell cannot hinder the worke of faith when God intendeth to work it. <hi>As many a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> are ordained unto eternall life ſhall believe,</hi> Acts 13.48.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:180666:141"/>
                  <hi>All Chriſts ſheep ſhall hear his voyce,</hi> Ioh. 10.16. <hi>The gathering of the people ſhall be unto</hi> Shilo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. God hath determined the thing to be done, before it is done. <hi>And all his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of olde are faithfulneſſe and truth,</hi> Iſa 25.1. He ſhould be unfaithfull, if his determinations ſhould not come to paſſe. The Apoſtle in the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. ſaith, <hi>that the Saints have obtained an inheritance, being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of God, who worketh all things according to his owne will.</hi> And if we conſider the eternall Counſell and determination, forgiving faith to ſome particular perſon, we ſhall finde, that it is impoſſible, that theſe men ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in that moment in which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to worke faith in their heart, and therefore the Apoſtle doth acquaint us with the immutability of this counſell, <hi>Heb.</hi> 16.17. And <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>That with God there is no variableneſſe, nor ſhadow of turning.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing God doth diſpenſe the gifts of his grace unto his people, according to his unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable decrees, and unchangeable counſells, it will be evident, that he worketh upon men ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtably. God ſhould erre in his preſcience or fore-knowledge of things, if he ſhould fore-ſee and determine, that a man ſhould believe, and that man at the ſame time ſhould remaine in unbeliefe. As an Aſtrologer would be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:180666:142"/>if he ſhould fore-ſee and fore-tell, that a thing ſhould come to paſſe, and the thing fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told ſhould not come to paſſe. It muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therefore, that Gods decrees are certaine irrevocable, and immutable, and that God working according to theſe decrees, doth worke irreſiſtably, and therefore faith is his gift, becauſe it proceedeth from his irreſiſtable power according to that of our Apoſtle, <hi>It is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Darkneſſe cannot create light. Faith is a ſpirituall light, and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come from our darkneſſe, but muſt have its birth and beginning from ſome heavenly light. And God is the powerfull light, from whom faith is beamed into our hearts. Five things are required to ſeeing, 1. A viſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. 2. The organ of fight. 3. A light to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this object. 4. A medium through which this object is to be ſeene. 5. That the organ be in a living and waking creature. And theſe things are likewiſe requiſite to ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing ſpiritually by faith, which all are from the power of God. 1. It is God doth preſent doth us the ſpirituall object, which is to be looked upon for ſalvation. 2. It is God giveth us ſpirituall organs or eyes. 3. Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all light to diſcover ſpirituall things. 4. A me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, Ieſus Chriſt, through whom wee looke
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:180666:142"/>upon him. 5. A ſpirituall life and being. It is a thing proper and peculiar to God, to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a thing out of nothing, and it is his prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative and power in believing, to make us new creatures. By which it will appear, that true faith cannot be of our ſelves, <hi>but it is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, That which ſtabliſheth Saints in the faith, that power doth at the firſt, worke faith in them: but God by his power doth ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25. The Apoſtle doth make it a priviledge proper to the power of God to ſtabliſh Saints in the faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is proper to his power to bring us to the faith.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The promiſes of God in giving Chriſt <hi>to open the blinde eyes,</hi> Iſa 42.6, 7. His engagements to teach us to know him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Prophet, <hi>All thy children ſhall be taught of God.</hi> His covenant in Chriſt, <hi>that we ſhall know him,</hi> Heb. 8. doth ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate, that nothing below the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power of God, inſufficient for the ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of us to reſt upon his owne grace for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I need not ſpend many words in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this, becauſe the argument laid downe to prove the negative part of the Text, wil reach the affirmative. For if not of our ſelves, it will unqueſtionably follow, that it is of God that we are enabled to believe.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:180666:143"/>
               <p>In the next place I ſhall prove, that as it is the work of his power, ſo it is the worke of his owne free grace. When he enableth a man to believe, he puts forth not only the power of his omnipotency, but the power of his grace: he doth not looke upon any thing in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to move him to give faith to the creature: but he lookes upon his own grace, and he ſees no other motive or argument to move him to give faith to men, but thoſe that lye in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of his owne grace from the dayes of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>I ſhall prove this firſt by Scripture, and then by ſome conſiderations. Firſt, you have it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Scripture, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>To you it is given not only to believe, but to ſuffer.</hi> Hence I gather, that it is the gift of Gods grace to enable a man to believe: As it is the free gift of Gods grace to call forth a man to ſuffer for him. So in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. The Apoſtle bids <hi>Timothy</hi> with <hi>meekeneſs of ſpirit to endeavour to recover thoſe that oppoſed the doctrine and truth which he held forth and preached.</hi> If peradventure God will give them repentance for the acknowledging of the truth. You ſee then God muſt give repentance, or changedneſſe of minde, by which he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabled to believe truth to the glory of God. Now as I have cleared it by Scripture, ſo I ſhal cleare it by ſome conſiderations;</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:180666:143"/>
               <p>The firſt ſhall be drawne from the promiſes of God. The promiſes as they do prove, that man cannot doe any thing by his owne power, but that all is done for us by the power of God, ſo they prove that all is done for our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good by grace. For promiſes of the new Covenant doe not only acquaint us with the power, but grace of God.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> had beene preſerved in his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and never had fallen, he had been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the power of God; but not by the grace of God; as grace is ſtrictly taken in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace: ſo that as we have proved, that <hi>faith is not of our ſelves, but from the power of God</hi> by leading you to the promiſe; ſo, now we ſhal prove, <hi>that we are ſaved by grace through faith,</hi> by bringing you back again, to look upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as they are the ſtream; &amp; flowings forth of Gods grace unto us. What need God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to do that which we are able to do of our ſelves? Therefore ſeeing we have the promiſe of grace for it, wee may conclude that it is by grace, &amp; not by any power in our ſelves. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.12, wee have a promiſe for faith, In him (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>ſhall the Gentiles truſt.</hi> So likewiſe in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 24.7. We have a promiſe of God, that hee will give us the knowledge of himſelfe. <hi>I will give them an heart to know mee, that I am the Lord, and they ſhall be my people, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:180666:144"/>I will be their God: and they ſhall return unto mee with their whole heart.</hi> Here God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give us a heart that we ſhall know him.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing God hath promiſed to give us a heart to know him: therefore I conclude wee are not able to give ſuch a heart to our ſelves. God hath promiſed to circumciſe our hearts, to take away the fore-skin of our ſpirits, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are not able to circumciſe our ſelves. God hath promiſed to turne us, therefore wee are not able to turns our ſelves. <hi>Turn us O Lord and we ſhall be turned,</hi> Lam. 5.21. Intimating thus much, that we cannot come towards him, till hee turne the face and countenance of his favour toward us, anſwering to that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>I have ſurely heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a bullocke unaccuſtomed to the yoake: turne thou me, and I ſhall he turned.</hi> And therefore God doth uſually mixe promiſes with exhortations, that man ſhould not conclude from Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations unto him, that there is a ſufficient power in him to doe what hee is exhorted to doe, as in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14. when he had exhorted <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el to returne unto the Lord,</hi> he preſently addeth, verſ. 4. <hi>I will heale their backeſliding.</hi> All the Prophets doe ſubſcribe to this truth, <hi>Jona</hi> 2.9. <hi>Salvation is of the Lord by promiſe. He will teach us his wayes, and we will walke in his paths,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:180666:144"/>
                  <hi>Micab,</hi> Mic. 4.2. and <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>I will leave in the midſt of thee an afflicted and poore people, and they ſhall truſt in the name of the Lord.</hi> God will fill his ſpirituall houſe or Temple with glory; <hi>And I will give peace,</hi> ſaith the Lord of hoſts, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.9. <hi>God will be the glory in the middeſt of the ſpirituall Jeruſalem,</hi> Zech. 2.9. <hi>And hee will remove the iniquity of the land in one day,</hi> v. 3.9. All theſe promiſes are plaine demonſtrations of Gods powerfull grace, and mans weakneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we have not only the bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but the Covenant of God, and this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant confirmed and bound by an oath, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Thou wilt performe the truth to</hi> Jacob, <hi>and the mercy to</hi> Abraham, <hi>which thou haſt ſworn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Fathers;</hi> therefore it is not by any power or worke in our ſelves. If it be the fruit of the covenant of grace, and God hath covenanted in his grace to doe it for us, then certainly wee are not able to doe it our ſelves. But God hath covenanted to doe it for us; he hath covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to write his law in our hearts: <hi>The law of faith,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Therefore we are not able to work faith in our own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Why ſhould God tye himſelfe in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and binde this Covenant with an oath to doe this for us: if we were able to doe it our ſelves, why ſhould God doe any thing for his owne names ſake, if the creature can do enough
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:180666:145"/>to make it ſelfe happy by his owne ſtrength. In vaine is a Covenant of grace promulgated for mans ſalvation, and for diſcovery of this ſalvation; If man can finde out the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by his owne wiſdome, why muſt Chriſt <hi>guide our ſeete into the wayes of peace,</hi> Luke 1. if of our ſelves we can find out theſe ways of life &amp; peace. God hath made it his work, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not our work wrought by our owne ſtrength. God hath promiſed faith as a gift freely to be beſtowed upon undeſerving man, therfore man by the improvement of his parts and labour, cannot purchaſe it as the reward of his endeavours.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God worketh faith in time accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his eternall purpoſe, and decree before time. But the eternall purpoſe of God, is the purpoſe of his grace, therefore God worketh faith according to his purpoſe of grace. The firſt of theſe propoſitions hath beene already proved, the ſecond is evident from 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. So that it is evident that faith floweth from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall grace; <hi>and therefore it is not of ourſelves, but it is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is nothing can merit or deſerve faith in man, before faith is wrought, and therefore it is given as a free gift. This is plaine by <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. <hi>It is not of him that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:180666:145"/>mercy,</hi> John 1.13. There may be as much in one that ſhall be damned, as in him that ſhall be ſaved before his converſion. <hi>Peter</hi> did no more to merit, or deſerve his firſt faith, then <hi>Iudas</hi> did. Gods grace is his rule by which he worketh, in giving faith unto any man, and therefore <hi>faith is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Gods deſigne in juſtifying a ſinner through faith, as hath beene formerly proved, is the magnifying of his owne free love unto the creature in Chriſt; and therfore hee doth acquaint us, that faith is the free gift of his grace, that ſo hee may deveſt the creature of glorying in himſelf, or in any thing from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. If the Father ſhould juſtifie us by grace through faith, and wee ſhould apprehend that our faith were of our ſelves, there would bee ſome glorying in our ſelves. And therefore he doth juſtifie by grace, through faith, as a fruit, effect, and free gift of his owne grace. So proud we are naturally, that though wee were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that we were ſaved by grace, as a gift given unto us; (as almes unto a beggar) yet we ſhould be proud, if wee knew that of our ſelves we had an hand to receive it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth not only in his grace give us the gift of eternall life, but the hand by which we receive it. Thus <hi>wee are ſaved by grace through faith, which is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:180666:146"/>
               <p>Sixthly, The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that no man can ſay that Jeſus is the Chriſt, but by the holy Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3. But by faith we confeſſe that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Chriſt, and therefore it doth plainly follow, that it is from the holy Spirit of grace.</p>
               <p>The Spirit doth ſhew, <hi>that all things are freely given us of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.12. And therefore faith is freely given us of God. If e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, then faith. <hi>Every good and perfect gift commeth downe from the Father of lights,</hi> if we will believe <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 1.17. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt grant <hi>that faith is given unto us of God,</hi> or elſe deny it to be a good and perfect gift.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj:</hi> But ſome may ſay, if faith be a gift, why doth our Saviour bid us <hi>to buy gold tryed in the fire, that we may be cloathed, that the ſhame of our nakedneſſe may not appeare,</hi> Rev. 3.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This word buying is taken proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo it ſignifieth the purchaſing of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, by ſome conſiderable price which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for it.</p>
               <p>There can be no buying of a thing without ſome price. (<hi>Nulla exemptio ſine pretio eſſe poteſt. Juſtinian in ſtit. lib.</hi> 3 <hi>Tit.</hi> 24.) And in this ſence wee cannot buy faith or Chriſt, having no conſiderable price to pay for Chriſt, before we enjoy Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> Buying is taken improperly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:180666:146"/>
                  <hi>Buy wine and milke without money, and without price.</hi> And if faith be to be bought, it muſt be thus bought by us, we have no money or price to part with for faith. And what is thus bought by us, is freely given unto us; So that this objection is too weake to weaken the truth which hath beene delivered. It ſtandeth ſtill unſhaken, and unmoveable upon its owne Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, <hi>Faith is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having proved it ſufficiently by theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, that faith is a gift, I ſhall draw ſome uſefull concluſions from them, and put a period to my diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This overthroweth the meritoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the righteouſneſſe of our owne works qualifications or preparations before faith for the deſerving any thing at the hand of God to ingage him to give us faith. What we receive as a free gift, cannot be given us in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our merits or deſervings.</p>
               <p>I ſhall but touch this, becauſe I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taken paines to beate downe the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian monſter of Free-will, and merit of workes: which like two twinnes of the ſame wombe, doe live and dye in the ſame moment. It is the Lord Jeſus muſt ſeeke us, before ever we can finde him. And we cannot as we ought deſire faith, untill faith be freely beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:180666:147"/>infinite power, to enable us to believe. Therfore I conclude, that wee are not able to reſiſt the power of God, when hee is determined to give us faith. Faith being the gift of his Almighty power.</p>
               <p>But ſome may here object with the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus</hi> that place of <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7.51. <hi>Ye ſtiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked, and uncircumciſed in heart and eares, yee have alway reſiſted the holy Spiri.</hi> Here (ſay they) you ſee that men have reſiſted the holy Spirit; therefore God doth not ſo worke upon men by the power of his grace, that he leaves them altogether unable to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that there is a two-fold power that God puts forth. An ordinary power in the preaching of his Word; when by intreaties, beſeeching, and promiſes, and the like, he allures, and enticeth men in the preaching of the Word, and knocking at the doores of their hearts for entrance. This common worke of the ſpirit may be reſiſted, and ſo all wicked and ungodly men in this ſenſe reſiſt the Spirit of God, and reject the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But there is another power of the ſpirit, and that is that inward ſpirituall power, by which God comes on thoſe whom he intends to ſave; thus he comes, not only in the preaching of the Word in the language of man, but in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:180666:148"/>of heaven. And though the former worke of the Spirit may be reſiſted, this latter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſiſted. Though wee may reject the Word of God preached in the letter, and ſome common workings of the ſpirit in our owne hearts, and not give entertainement to Jeſus Chriſt when hee knockes at the doore of our hearts in the preaching of the Word; yet when it comes downe with power to open the heart as he did <hi>Lydia's;</hi> we are not able to prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, when God intends powerfully to open the doore of our ſpirits, we are not able to keepe it lockt: he will ſweetly force us to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the door, and by his ſpirit and grace brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:180666:148"/>the fall, that never a man or woman in the world ſhould ever be ſaved by Chriſt. And this abſurdity will follow from it, that God after mans fall, could not be certaine that any man ſhould be ſaved by Chriſt, and ſo it would take away the fore-knowledge of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not know, but that every man in the world might reſiſt &amp; reject Jefus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This may give in ſome ſupport to ſome trembling hearers, who are convinced by the ſpirit of unbeliefe, and are not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt. Thou art ready to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, when thou apprehendeſt, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for thee truly to believe of thy ſelfe, but let thy ſpirit be upheld with this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that God is able to give thee faith while I am ſpeaking of faith, and ſhewing thee the worker of it. It may be thou thinkeſt that thou ſhalt never have joy, comfort, and aſſurance of ſalvation, but by believing, and yet thou are not able to believe, and therefore comfort thy ſelfe in this, though thou canſt doe nothing, God is able to enable thee <hi>to doe all things,</hi> Phil. 4.13. As the Martyr when ſome told him that when he came to ſuffer, he wold rather deny his tenets, then burn. It is true, ſaid he, I of my ſelfe ſhould doe ſo: but God is able to enable me. So though thou knoweſt that thou of thy ſelfe canſt not believe, know that God is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:180666:149"/>able to enable thee preſently to believe. Thou that haſt had experience of thy unbelieving heart, and of that mountaine of infidelity that lies upon thy ſpirit, and that thou art able to ſay, I ſhall never be able to believe of my ſelfe while the world ſtands: know that God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blde in this momentt to give thee faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This may informe us concerning the nature of true faith; by which it may bee diſtinguiſhed from the faith of hypocriticall Formaliſts. The hypocrite not being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his owne diſability, for the working of ſaving faith in his owne heart, doth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that he can doe the worke of God by himſelfe in his own ſtrength; (like the carnall hearers of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 6.28. <hi>What ſhall wee doe, that wee may worke the worke of God</hi>) And when he apprehendeth, that he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he gloryeth more in his owne actings, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourings, and endeavours, (by which hee conceiveth that he hath obtainned faith) then in the grace of the Lord Jeſus; having no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual knowledg of that faith which is wrought by the Almightines of Gods powerful &amp; irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable grace. But if it is otherwiſe with a true ſonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> his faith is of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, having a ſpirituall, and heavenly tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in it, from that ſpirit, by whom it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> wrought. He prizeth not his faith of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:180666:149"/>ſpirit, but the faith of his heavenly ſpirit. He can ſet his ſeale to that truth, of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>John</hi> 6.65. <hi>That no man can come unto him, except it were give a unto him of his Father;</hi> he is not proud of his faith, becauſe hee looking upon it in the glaſſe of Gods free grace, doth account it rather Gods worke then his owne. According to that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 6. <hi>This is the worke of God, that ye believe.</hi> Vpon which words one of the Ancients hath this obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>(Non dixit hoc eſt opus veſtrum, ſed hoc eſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Dei.)</hi> He ſaid not, this is your worke, <hi>but the worke of God.</hi> Our Saviour ſpeaking to his Diſciples, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.11. <hi>To you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is given to know the myſteries of the kingdom of God; but unto them that are without, all thoſe things are done in parables.</hi> The Goſpell of the Lord Jeſus is a myſtery and parable unto many, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Lord doth give us the precious gift of faith, by which we underſtand theſe myſteries of God: ſo that he that truly underſtands the myſterie of the Kingdome, doth look upon his ſpirituall knowledge as a gift. What is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect faith? but the gift of God, by which we believe, that all our ſpirituall good things, and faith it ſelfe is freely given unto us by God. (<hi>Quae eſt plena et perfect a fides? Quae credit ex Deo et omnia bona noſtra, et ipſam fidem.</hi> Aug.)</p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:180666:150"/>
               <p>Fifthly, This may convince thoſe of their errour, who being convinced of ſinne, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to turne into the true way of ſalvation by believing, ſuppoſing in the pride and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their hearts, that this is too ſhort and neare a way to Juſtification and happineſſe. Theſe will firſt doe good workes, get ſtrength againſt all their corruptions, be made holy &amp; ſanctified men, and then they thinke that they may ſafely make bold to lay hold of ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace for juſtification and ſalvation. It was thus with me, when God did at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to awaken my conſcience with the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fight of my ſins, and courſe of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in which I had lived, and ſome months I went in this way; never in the ſpirit, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the object of Gods juſtifying grace was an ungodly man and a ſinner, and not knowing that ſpirituall regeneration is not by the workes of the Law, but the doctrine of the Goſpel, though I could then in a carnall way (as many blind Proteſtants now can) have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and preached more gloriouſly with rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall words and flouriſhing expreſſions of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by faith, without workes, then now I can, or will. But as God, who from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, had ſingled me out unto ſalvation by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, was pleaſed to convince mee of my ignorance, and to bring mee to reſt upon his
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:180666:150"/>grace in his ſonne, as a poore wretched ſinner, enabling me to believe that my ſins were blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out for his owne Names ſake, though my ſins did teſtifie againſt me. So theſe who are in the ſame condition, in which I then was, if they are in the number of thoſe, whom God hath given unto his ſonne Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be convinced, that by faith through Chriſt wee have acceſſe to the Throne of grace with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that faith is not given in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any preceding acts of holineſſe, or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, but as the free gift of our heavenly Father. That <hi>they who have thus erred in ſpirit,</hi> Iſa. 29.24. <hi>may come unto underſtanding, and ſuch who have murmured againſt the truth of Gods grace, may learn doctrine.</hi> Give me leave briefly to lay downe ſome convincing conſiderations, which may bring to your remembrance thoſe things which we have more fully handled.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Conſi.</hi> The word and promiſes which we doe enjoy, are fre gifts of Gods favour. What reaſon can we give, why we ſhould enjoy the outward meanes of grace, rather then <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> but his owne free grace, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 147.19. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his ſtatutes and his judgements unto</hi> Iſrael. It is the Lord that bringeth the externall meanes and word of grace as a gift (more worth then the whole world) unto a people. According to that

               <p>Seventhly, Let us prize faith as a gift; wee prize gifts, becauſe there is uſually ſome preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and goodneſſe in them, or elſe for the givers ſake. Faith is precious in it ſelfe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. Gods gifts have ſomething of his owne goodneſſe in them, and faith is to be prized becauſe it is from him. It is ſaid of <hi>Elkanah</hi> that <hi>he gave portions to</hi> Peninnah, <hi>and her ſonnes and daughteas: but unto</hi> Hannah <hi>he gave a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy portion, for he loved her,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.4, 5. So God doth give portions to the men of the world, but his worthy portion of love to his Saints, through faith, and therefore prize it. Imitate thoſe bleſſed ſoules, who have ſhewed unto us by their good examples, how they pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed faith, who were contented to part rather with their honours, pleaſures, riches, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea their owne lives then the faith of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:180666:153"/>the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt. <hi>They loved not their lives unto the death,</hi> Rev.</p>
               <p n="8">8ly. Faith is a great gift, which if thou haſt it, thou knoweſt that thou haſt freely received it. (<hi>Fides magnum aliquid eſt, quam ſi habes profecto, accepiſti.</hi> Aug.) And therefore look up unto God, for wretched, unbelieving creatures think that they may rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve faith as a gift which they will never be able to deſerve as a reward. This may ſtrengthen faith much when we are before the Throne of grace, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging faith for poore ſinners, if wee conſider that faith is a free gift. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> made uſe of ſuch an argument to ſtrengthen his faith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.7. <hi>Though our iniquities doe teſtifie againſt us, doe for thy Names ſake.</hi> O the happineſſe of thoſe who are acquainted with free grace, they may expect all things for themſelves and others, as free gifts to be given unto them, though they can expect nothing as deſerved wages.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Give glory to God for his unſpca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable grace in giving faith unto thee. My faith O Lord, ſaith one, hath called upon thee, which thou haſt given unto mee, and which thou haſt inſpired into me. (<hi>Invoeavit te de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, fides mea quam dediſti mihi, quam inſpiraſti mihi.</hi> Aug. Conſ.) So bleſſe God with that faith, and for that faith which God hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given thee. The Sonne of God hath given
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:180666:154"/>us an underſtanding to know God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. And this knowledg is the gift of faith. (<hi>Quid aliud eſt fides, quam vera de Deo cognitio.</hi> Cyp.) And therefore bleſſe God in the Sonne for this faith. Thou mighteſt have laine in the darke dungeon of an unbelieving heart to this day, and thou art brought into the wonderful light of the liberty of the Goſpell through faith. The Soune hath made thee free, and thou art free indeed by believing. Be free in rendring largely the tribute of praiſe to him, who through faith hath knocked off the ſhackles &amp; ſetters of bondage from thy ſoule. Give thy ſelfe to him who hath given himſelfe and his Sonne to thee through faith. And begin to live the heavenly life of glory, in giving glory and praiſe to him, who hath given thee the glory of union with himſelfe in his Sonne, through faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>Give praiſe to the King of</hi> Zion, <hi>who hath redeemed thee to God by his own blood, and made thee a King and Prieſt, and hath aſſured thee that thou ſhalt reigne upon the earth.</hi> Say of faith, and all the gifts of his Spirit, as <hi>Iacob</hi> of his children, theſe are children which God hath graciouſly given unto his ſervant. Aſcribe nothing to thy ſelfe, but all to him from whom are all things. Crye with a loud voyce; <hi>Salvation to our God which ſitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lambe; and ſing in faith</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:180666:154"/>with all Saints who love Chriſt in ſincerity, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Bleſſing, and Glory, and Wiſedome, and Thankeſ giving, and Honour, and Power, and Might, be unto our God for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Od in his grace hath ſhined into my ſpirit, by reading of theſe words, which hath inclined my ſpirit to ſpeake from theſe words. The truths of Chriſt are likely to prove powerfull upon the hearts of the hearers, when they are ſeconded with the experience of the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:180666:155"/>ſpeaker. I am therefore emboldned to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the truth, which is wrapt up in theſe words: though I know that there are many adverſaries and oppoſers of this truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. <hi>We believe, &amp; therefore we ſpeak,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. So I doe in ſpirit belive what I ſhall ſpeake, and therefore I am reſolved to ſpeake it forth plainly, and you are engaged to heare me patiently.</p>
               <p>The words are a concluſion drawn from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding premiſes. In the precedent words the Apoſtle delivered two propoſitions.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, That Chriſt hath appeared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the workes of the Devill; from whence he concludeth, <hi>that he which is born of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin,</hi> not having his being in the Devill; but in Chriſt, <hi>who deſtroyeth ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this verſe, there are theſe particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, which at the firſt view may preſent themſelves unto us.
<list>
                     <item>1. A character of a true Chriſtian. <hi>He is one who is borne of God.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The property of this man who is borne of God. <hi>He doth not commit ſin.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. A reaſon why he cannot commit ſin, to wit, <hi>becauſe his ſeed remaineth in him.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. His purity. He doth not only, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:180666:155"/>ſinne, <hi>but he ſinneth not at all.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>5. This aſſerted by laying down the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of his ſinning, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. He cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſinne.</item>
                     <item>6. This is further proved by his excellent &amp; glorious condition. <hi>He cannot ſin, becauſe he is borne of God.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt. From the perſon who is here ſpoken of, <hi>The man who is borne of God.</hi> We may take notice of the folly and Bedlam-madneſſe of ſome, who would be accounted profeſſors and Preachers of a ſpirituall Goſpel, whoſe Goſpel and myſtery of error doth make the man born of God, to be God. Confounding the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature of the Father, Word, and Spirit, with the new Creature. The Apoſtle doth plainly overthrow this Bedlam-Divinity by theſe expreſſions. In which hee doth make a difference between God, and the man who is born of him. That which is born of God, is borne in time. But God is from eternity. And therefore that which is born of God cannot be God.</p>
               <p>The place which they pervert is in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>He which is joyned to the Lord is one ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt, and the man joyned unto him are one, not by confounding of the perſon of Chriſt, with the perſon of a Believer, but by the union of theſe two in the Spirit. As the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:180666:156"/>members are one with the head, and yet the head is not the members, nor the members the head.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In this objection as they deſtroy the perſonall being of a Believer, ſo they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the perſonall being of Chriſt; as <hi>he is the Word made fleſh.</hi> There Chriſt is nothing but God; they apprehending that Chriſt hath offered up his humane nature, wiſedome and righteouſneſſe, as things of the firſt creation; and that hee hath no being now but in ſpirit, which they call Chriſt in the Spirit, the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall man, or God. I ſhall therefore in few words deliver the truth of God, concerning the man who is born of God.</p>
               <p>This phraſe is taken firſt largely, and ſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature may be ſaid to be of God, becauſe every creature is the workmanſhip of God, and hath its being from God. And in this ſence all wicked men are called <hi>the Off-ſpring of God,</hi> Acts 17.28. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is taken ſtrictly. And ſo it is to be underſtood not of thoſe who have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God by creation, but by ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. And thus it is here taken, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be borne of water &amp; the Spirit, he cannot enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. John</hi> 1 13. In this ſence neither God, Chriſt, or the Spirit <hi>are the new man,</hi> or
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:180666:156"/>
                  <hi>the man born of God.</hi> But the ſpeciall and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence of God through Chriſt by the ſpirit doth make a man <hi>a new Creature,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. John 1.13. 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>If any man is in Chriſt, he is a new Creature.</hi> He doth not ſay that if any man is in Chriſt, that then hee is Chriſt, or that Chriſt is the new creature, but that man who is in Chriſt, he is the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Having ſhewed you who the new man, or the man born of God, is, who is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, and freed the Text from fameliſticall blaſphemies. I ſhall deſire that you may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this truth.</p>
               <p>Every true Saint is a man born of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Conſid.</hi> It will not advantage a man to make a profeſſion of Chriſt, and to ſubmit to all the outward Ordinances of Chriſt, unleſſe a man be made a new creature by Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth any thing, nor uncir cumciſion, but a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> We muſt be borne againe, or elſe it had been better for us never to have been borne. Chriſt will not own any for his, or approve them as his Diſciples, whatſoever proſeſſion they doe make of him, unleſſe he be formed in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Know ye not that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be unapproved.</hi> They are the Devils children, <hi>who are not borne of God,</hi> John 8.44.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:180666:157"/>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Conſid.</hi> God hath engaged himſelfe in the Covenant of grace, that thoſe who are his, ſhall be borne of him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> As a Carver when he maketh an Image, doth begin at the outſide of the Timber, and cuts &amp; ſhaves and ſmooths that. So hypocrites doe begin at the outſide, and doe ſmooth themſelves in their outward converſation to men-ward. And ſo there is but an image inſteed of a new creature. But true Saints are made new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. Some ſay that the heart is the firſt thing which hath life. <hi>(Cor eſt primum vivens.)</hi> It is true, in the new creation, God doth give unto the veſſels of his grace new hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>With the heart man believeth unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> Jer. 32.39.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſid.</hi> Men who are not borne of God, cannot haue fellowſhip with God. <hi>If we ſay that we have fellow ſhip with him, and walk in darkneſſe, we lye,</hi> 1 John 1.6. <hi>But true Saints have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Father, and his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 John 1.3. <hi>And therefore they are borne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Conſid.</hi> God is to be known, ſerved, and worſhipped by true Saints: but we cannot truly know him, ſerve or worſhip him, ſo long as we are old creatures, in the ſtate of nature, and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:180666:157"/>therefore it cannot be denyed, that true Saints are borne of him. An old creature is ſpiritually dead, and cannot ſee God. A dead creature cannot performe the actions of a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And a ſinner cannot ſerve the living God, and performe that ſpirituall worſhip which God doth require of thoſe who are quickned to ſpirituall worſhip by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Conſid.</hi> The new Heaven and the new Earth is only provided for new creatures: but it is provided for Saints, and they expect it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. <hi>And therefore they are borne of God.</hi> Mat. 19.28. Our Saviour ſaith, that ſuch who have followed him in the regeneration, <hi>ſhall ſit upon Thrones.</hi> The Saints are tranſlated out of the Kingdome of the world into the kingdome of grace, by ſpirituall regeneration, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall be tranſlated from the Kingdome of grace, into the Kingdome of glory. By theſe conſiderations it is evident, that true Saints <hi>are borne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let us not try our Saint-ſhip by our large profeſſions of Chriſt, and ſubjection to ſuch things which we apprehend to be his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances for externall worſhip; but by our new creation. It concerneth every man to be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly aſſured of his heavenly birth, who would make his claime good for heaven and glory; and be aſſured <hi>that he ſhall eſcape the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:180666:158"/>of Hell.</hi> As our Saviour ſaid of <hi>Judas,</hi> Mat. 26.24. <hi>That it had been good for him, he had not been borne.</hi> So it had been good for us that we had never been borne, if wee ſhall live and dye profeſſors of the knowledge of God in Chriſt, and not dye poſſeſſors of God in Chriſt by the new creation. Conſider therefore</p>
               <p n="1">1. That every change or alteration which may be wrought in a man, doth not make him a Sonne of God by ſpirituall regeneration. Morall principles may make a great change in a man. And Phariſaicall principles may make a man ſeeme to be very religious, to himſelfe and others. But the Phariſees proſelite is farre enough from a true Convert. <hi>And except our righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, we cannot enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> We may walke farre in the way of the Law, and performance of duties, to make our ſelves new creatures, and the Sonnes of God by our own righteouſneſſe and legall reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and may at laſt ſtumble at Chriſt, and never come to know what it is to be borne of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man may take a long walke in the path of the Goſpell, and may after a ſort eſcape the pollutions of the world by Goſpel-principles and may taſte of the powers of the world to come, &amp; in the concluſion may ſit down ſhort
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:180666:158"/>of a new creation here, and glory hereafter, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. Never truly knowing what it is to have the Spirit in him, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the Spirit, God in him, and himſelfe in God, Chriſt in him, and himſelfe in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quer.</hi> But by what meanes is a man born of God may ſome one ſay, ſeeing it concerneth us to know that we are born of God, and it is ſo eaſie to be miſtaken.</p>
               <p>It is not by the law, by that thou maiſt have a knowledge of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. but canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive a new life. The law bringeth forth ſervants, not ſons, <hi>Iſhmaelites,</hi> not true <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> Gal. 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thoſe who are borne of God, are children of the Goſpell, not by the workes of the law, but by the hearing of faith wee are made new creatures. In this Miniſtery God by his Spirit through faith in his Sonne maketh new creatures. Nothing in nature can beethe cauſe of it ſelfe, ſo nothing in the new creation can be the cauſe of it ſelfe. There muſt be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before there can be a Sonne. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore through faith in his Sonne is the cauſe of this new creation. In this Miniſtery God doth not ſpeak only by letters and ſyllables, but by his eternall Word and Spirit. Our ſoules are purified in the obedience of the truth of the Goſpel, unto unfeigned love of the Brethren,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:180666:159"/>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>And are borne againe not of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi> In this Miniſtry of life and ſalvation, we have an eye <hi>to ſee the olde man crucified in the ſuffering of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 6.6. <hi>That henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi> In this Miniſtery wee ſee Chriſt as that new man which maketh all things new, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 5. The olde <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood as a publique perſon to bring ſhame, ſinne, and ſorrow upon his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ſo Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and new man, by whom we are renewed, doth bring holy boldneſſe, righteouſneſſe, and joy. <hi>Adam</hi> communicated his ſinfull nature to us, ſo Chriſt doth communicate his divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto us, with thoſe fruits and effects of the ſpirit, which are contrary to the nature of the old man; Uniting us unto himſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming a principle of life to us and in us. And as one ſaith of generation, that it doth not conſiſt in the production of a new form, but in the union of the form to the matter. <hi>(Generatie non conſiſtit in productione ſed unitione formae, cummateria.)</hi> So ſpiritual regeneration is not by the production of a new forme, but by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the forme to the matter. By uniting Chriſt, who is as the forme to man who is the matter of the new creature. And as wee ſay that the generation of one thing is the corrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:180666:159"/>or deſtruction of another thing; ſo in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall regeneration the old man is deſtroyed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>They that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts.</hi> O how is the man placed in the uppermoſt roome of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and higheſt ſeat of happineſſe, who is ſpiritually acquainted with this truth. Hee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercommeth the world <hi>by believing that Jeſus is the Sonne of God,</hi> 1 John 5.1. He admireth the inexpreſſible love of God, <hi>by which hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sonne of God,</hi> 1 John 3.1. He is borne to poſſeſſe the unſearcheable riches of Gods grace. He is born to inherit large poſſeſſions, <hi>&amp; a golrious inheritance, being joynt heir with Chriſt,</hi> Ro. 8.17. Hee is higher by his birth, then the Sons of Kings and Emperours. Chriſt &amp; he are of one, &amp; therfore he is not aſhamed to cal him Brother, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. And now hee begins to reſolve to live like himſelfe, to live anſwerable to his condition of glory and honour, unto which God of his grace hath brought him. He wil live as one who hath hopes full of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. He wil put on Chriſt in his converſation, as he hath put him on in his free juſtification. A King will not ſtoope to the earth to take up farthings, as a beggar will, nor meddle with ſuch mean buſineſſes and employments, in which men of meane condition doe exerciſe themſelves. So hee will not ſtoop in ſpirit to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:180666:160"/>the love of the things of the world, which are but as a farthing to the things of glory and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Hee will not follow worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as though hee had no other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>His converſation is in Heaven,</hi> Phil. 3. He is one of the <hi>Choſen generation, and royall Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, holy Nation, and peculiar People,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is reſolved to ſhew forth the praiſes of him <hi>who hath called him out of darkneſſe, into his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. from impurity to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, from a diſgracefull and reproachfull condition, to honour and favour; from vaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage to a kingdome; from feare of death, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of eternall life; from hell to heaven; from horror of conſcience, to joy in believing; from a dunghill, to a Throne; from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrath, to never-ending glory, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. I might ſpeak more fully of this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> no man can ſpeak ſufficiently. But my intention was not to ſpeak of this, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is principally intended in the words, to ſhew you the ſinleſſe condition of the man which is borne of God. And therefore give me leave, to leave this point, that I may briefly open the words which follow in the Text, that ſo I may draw the marrow and ſubſtance of them into a ſhort concluſion, the illuſtration, confirmation, and amplification of which, by the grace of God ſhall be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my enſuing diſcourſe.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:180666:160"/>I doe finde that the godly-learned doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in their expoſitions of theſe words. I ſhall therefore acquaint you with their ſeverall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and ſhall enlarge my thoughts in the amplifying of that which I doe apprehend in truth, to be the meaning of the Apoſtle in theſe words.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Some ſay that he cannot commit ſin. That is <hi>(Non poteſt operam dare peceate.)</hi> He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make ſin his work, trade, or employment, and this is a truth. The rode of prophaneſſe and wilfull ſinning, hath never been the way in the which the Saints have walked. Their path is the path of purity and uprightneſſe. But this doth not ſeeme to be the meaning of the Spirit in this place. For the Apoſtle doth not only ſay, <hi>that he cannot commit ſin; but hee cannot ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Others ſay, <hi>that he cannot commit ſin, as a ſervant of ſin.</hi> As though our Saviours words were a ſufficient expoſition of theſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Whoſoever committeth ſinne, is a ſervant of ſin.</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) He doth not doe ſin as his worke, as a ſervant doth work by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and commandement of his Maſter. I queſtion not the truth of this. <hi>Sinne ſhall not have dominion,</hi> where Chriſt is Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the ſoule. He taketh our ſoules in unto himſelfe by conqueſt, and will not ſuffer thoſe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:180666:161"/>who commanded us before his conqueſt to rule over us, now he hath ſubdued them. As a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering King will not ſuffer conquered Rebels to command his Subjects. But the Apoſtle doth not ſeeme to drive only at this, becauſe as it hath been obſerved, he ſaith afterwards, <hi>that he cannot ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Some ſay that he cannot ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot commit the unpardonable ſin. And theſe goe as far as the end of the Epiſtle, for an expoſition, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.17.18. All iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſinne, and there is a ſinne <hi>not unto death. Wee know that whoſoever is borne of God ſinneth not, But hee that is borne of God keepeth himſelfe and the wicked one toucheth him not.</hi> Thus they affirme that he finneth not, becauſe <hi>hee ſinneth not unto death.</hi> This which they ſay is likewiſe an undenyable truth in it ſelfe: but not all, that the Apoſtle intendeth in theſe words. Which will evidently appear if we look ſeriouſly upon the precedent words. Where the Apoſtle doth ſet downe the Antitheſis and oppoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the man borne of God, and the naturall man. And doth make this the characteriſtical difference between the man borne of God, and the man of the Devill, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8. That the one doth ſinne, and the other doth not ſinne. <hi>Every one that abideth in him ſinneth not; &amp; he that ſinneth hath not known him, or ſeene him.</hi> And as
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:180666:161"/>no man will ſay that the difference in this place between the carnall and ſpirituall man is this. That the one doth not commit the unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſinne, and the other doth. For then this abſurdity will neceſſarily follow, that every carnall man doth commit the unpardonable ſin. For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that every carnal man is of the Devill, and ſinneth,</hi> (that is, againſt the holy Ghoſt, if we take their expoſition.) So no man may affirme that this is the meaning of theſe words (which are laid downe in way of oppoſition to the precedent) that he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth not ſin, doth not commit the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable ſin, for then this abſurdity will follow that every man who committeth not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable ſin, is born of God. And this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by the ſubſequent words, where he ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. That in this the children of God, and the children of the Devill are manifeſted. To wit, that the one doth not commit ſin, and the other doth commit ſin. Take the words accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their expoſition, and this is the ſence of them. In this the Saints and carnall men are diſtinguiſhed, that the Saints doe not commit the unpardonable ſin, and that all carnall men doe commit the unpardonable ſin. Of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of which tenet, contrariety to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and daily experience. I leave the ſpirituall man a judge.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Others ſay that he ſinneth not. That is in his juſtified ſtate and condition he ſinneth not. Becauſe he is free from ſin, and the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law. And this is a truth likewiſe full of comfort and ſweetneſſe. That the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or man borne of God doth not ſin in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to juſtification. Their meaning is, that there is no ſin from which a believer is not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. But the Apoſtle doth not ſpeake only of this, for he ſpeaketh of his working of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe by love, in this place, and through the whole Epiſtle, as well as of believing. And of ſuch workes which Saints are to doe, by which they may be juſtified before men; as theſe men doe grant themſelves, and therefore this is not to be taken ſo ſtrictly in reference to our juſtification through faith only. As theſe words do declare it ſufficiently. <hi>Every one that worketh not righteouſneſſe, is not of God, and hee that loveth not his brother,</hi> verſ. 10.</p>
               <p>Doth he pray for ſuch, whom he thought were no where to be found, or for all true Saints whom he did know did love the Lord Jeſus in corruption.</p>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:180666:162"/>from the better part. And therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth call us <hi>Saints, or holy men,</hi> Epheſ. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe we are ſpiritually regenerated or made new creatures, though much of the fleſh doth remaine in the beſt of us. And this I doe apprehend to be the meaning of God in this place. So <hi>Cajetan</hi> upon the words: Hee doth (ſaith he) underſtand it formally, that is in as much <hi>as he is borne of God;</hi> for our new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God doth not ſuffer us to ſin. <hi>(Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligit formaliter, hoc eſt, quatenus ex Deo natus. Nativitas enim ex Deo non dat peccare.)</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that faithfull Martyr <hi>Tyndall</hi> ſpeaketh in the opening of theſe words. God and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill are two contrary Fathers, two contrary fountaines, two contrary cauſes; the one of all goodneſſe, the other of all evill. And they that doe evill are borne of the Devill, and are firſt evill by that birth, before they doe evill. And on the other ſide, they that doe good, <hi>are firſt borne of God,</hi> and receive of his nature and ſeed, and by the reaſon of that nature and ſeed, are firſt good, before they doe good by the ſame rule. And Chriſt who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Devill, came to deſtroy the works of the Devill in us, and to give us a new birth, a new nature, and to ſow new ſeed in us, that we ſhould by reaſon of that birth ſinne no more. And he hath a paralell place to this in
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:180666:163"/>the ſame expoſition of this Epiſtle. <hi>As there is no ſin</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in Chriſt</hi> the ſtock, <hi>ſo can there be none in the quicke members that live and grow in him by faith. Calvin</hi> in his inſtruction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Libertines,</hi> bringing in this place of <hi>John</hi> as an argument of theirs, to prove that they doe never ſin, doth anſwer them by this expoſition of the words. <hi>Johns</hi> words doe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing elſe but this; That a man as farre as he is regenerated of God, cannot ſin. <hi>(Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannis verba nihil aliud ſignificant, quam homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, quatenus regeneratus eſt a Deo, non peccare.)</hi> I might multiply Authors, ſpeaking ſometimes to this purpoſe: but for my part I doe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this way of Preaching, or frequent quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Authors in Sermons (yet ſometimes I am neceſſitated unto it: and for the hardneſſe of hearts of hearers, doe thinke that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be done in this way for the gaining of them in unto truth. As <hi>Ameſius</hi> doth deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his judgment in his caſes of conſcience. But ſecondly, I muſt profeſſe ingenuouſly, that moſt men whom I might bring in, to ſpeake to this truth, doe ſeeme to contradict in other places of their writings, what they have delivered concerning this truth. And therefore I ſhall only bring Scripture to prove what I doe deſire to deſend for the truth of God, knowing that Scripture is ſufficient of it ſelf for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:180666:163"/>of truth. And that the judgements and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of all the learned men that ever were, or ſhall be, are nothing at all without it. As <hi>David</hi> ſaid of the ſword of <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 Sam. 21.9. <hi>There is none like that.</hi> So no ſword or bow of men is like unto the Scripture, by which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is hewen down, and truth exalted. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall give you more fully my plaine and naked meaning in this point, and then ſhall ſhew you what Scripture will come in, to beare witneſſe to the truth which I have received from the Lord.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We are to take notice, that man in Scripture is conſidered phyſically, as he hath a rationall ſpirit joyned to an humane body. And when we thus ſpeake of man, wee doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that every man ſinneth, <hi>Lot, David, Peter, Paul,</hi> and the like; according to that of <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 3.2. <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We may looke upon man theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically. And if we thus conſider him, wee ſhall finde that in a ſpirituall ſenſe; every Chriſtian man hath two men in him, a new man, and and an olde man: and theſe two of contrary natures and operations. And as ſometimes we ſpeake of a man as having two phyſicall beings in him, and doe attribute unto him what is proper to his corporall and ſpirituall part, as when we ſay a man heareth, ſeeth, walketh,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:180666:164"/>underſtandeth, and the like, And then again, doe diſtinguiſh theſe two, attributing to the body what is proper to the body, and to the ſoule what is proper to the ſoule. So ſomtimes the Scripture doth ſpeak of man as having two contrary natures, and then doth againe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute that to the new or divine nature, which is proper unto that, and that unto the ſinfull and fleſhly nature which is proper unto it. In the olde and unregenerated nature there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſin, and the ſeed and ſpawn of all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe and uncleanneſſe. And in the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted part or new man, there is nothing but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and holineſſe. In this nature he doth no ſin, nor cannot ſin, as he cannot doe good it the other nature. So that I apprehend that the man borne of God is not ſinfull in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in any of his actings, workings, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations. Hee is light in his underſtanding holy in his will, pure in his thoughts, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his affections. It is well obſerved by <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger,</hi> That God doth allude to the nature of ſeede; the nature of which is retained by thoſe things which ſpring out of it. <hi>(Alludit ad ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis naturam, quamea referunt, quae ex eo naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur.) The ſeed being holy,</hi> that which ariſeth from it <hi>is likewiſe holy,</hi> as our Saviour doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme us, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is borne of the fleſh, is fleſh, and that which is borne of the ſpirit i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That which is borne of the Spirit, is ſaid to be ſpirit, becauſe it is made ſpirituall by the preſence of the holy Spirit in it.</p>
               <p>Having acquainted you with my meaning, and given you the ſpirituall interpretation of the words. I ſhall draw the marrow and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the particulars which I named, into one Concluſion, which I ſhall endeavour to make good by ſpirituall arguments which I ſhall draw from Scripture and ſpirituall reaſon. The concluſion is this.</p>
               <p>The ſpiritual man, or the man born of God, in his ſpirituall and godly nature, motions, &amp; actings towards God in Chriſt, doth not, nor cannot ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. His ſeed is holy in him, <hi>therefore his fruit is holy;</hi> this is the argument of the Apoſtle. <hi>His ſeed abideth in him, and therefore he cannot ſin.</hi> Chriſt is the ſeed in us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. Every true Chriſtian can ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>That Chriſt liveth in him;</hi> and Chriſt in us doth not ſuffer us to live ſinfully, but maketh us to live holily, he becomming the principle of an
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:180666:165"/>holy life and ſanctification in us. A Chriſtian is powerfully acted by an holy principle, and therefore his actings are holy. Chriſt is a pure fountaine of holineſſe in us, as well to fill our ſouls with the ſtreames of holineſſe by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as to waſh away the uncleaneſs of our ſouls in our Juſtification. <hi>And this ſountaine cannot ſend forth at the ſame place ſweet water and bitter,</hi> Jam. 3.11. The ſtreames doe retaine the pure nature of the fountain from whence they flow.</p>
               <p>(<hi>Reader, I muſt inform thee, that ſince I Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched this Sermon, I received objections from my learned friend Mr.</hi> R. L. <hi>againſt my arguments, which I thought good to print with my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As there is good ſeed, ſo there is a good ſoile, the ſpirituall heart, and therefore the argument will follow.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:180666:165"/>ye ſhall keepe my judgements, and doe them.</hi> The new heart of fleſh is a good ſoile. And becauſe God doth promiſe his Spirit, and a new heart, therefore ſee what ſhall follow? the good fruit ſpoken of: <hi>We ſhall keep his judgements, and doe them.</hi>

And there is none that calleth upon thy Name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee. For thou haſt hid thy face from us, and we are conſumed becauſe of our iniquities.</hi> We muſt not judge of this truth by expreſſions which holy men have made uſe of in confeſſing the ſins of the whole nation of the Jews, in the language of the Jewiſh nationall Covenant: but by thoſe paſſages of Scripture in which God doth ſpeake of a man as under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, with his works wrought by the ſpirit of grace.</p>

I may adde this, that if God had choſen us to love, joy, ſanctification, and the like, which are ſin, and ſinfull, that then he had choſen us to ſin, or to ſomething ſinfull; which conceit in my apprehenſion doth carry ſuch an abſurdity in the face of it, that it needeth not a Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

God doth free us from the law of works, and doth bring us under the covenant of grace, that we may by grace be enabled to doe thoſe works, which we are not able to doe by vertue of morall commands.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:180666:171"/>for ſanctification as the law, if all that were wrought in us under that covenant were ſin or ſinfull. And therefore it will follow that a man under grace hath a purity of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in him. God brings us from <hi>Moſes</hi> who was the Law-giver, and delivers us from the Covenant of works in giving us to Jeſus Chriſt who is the giver of grace, that he may make us holy in a gracious life and converſation.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſets this forth unto us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. <hi>But now wee are delivered from the law,</hi> that being dead wherein we were held: <hi>that we ſhould ſerve in newneſſe of ſpirit, and not in the oldneſſe of the letter.</hi> We are freed from the ſervice of God in the law of works (under which wee ſerve as ſlaves till wee be brought to Chriſt,) that wee may ſerve as ſonnes in obedience to all morall commands, under the ſweet, gracious, &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious government of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is as well <hi>a Law-giver,</hi> Iſa. 33.22. <hi>to write his lawes of faith and love in our hearts,</hi> Hebr. 8. <hi>As a Saviour to ſave us from our ſins.</hi> And to cut off all objections againſt this argument, wee may take notice, that the fruits of the ſpirit are not onely called good and holy, as they are in the promiſe or command: but they are good and holy, and called fruits of righteouſneſſe, as they are wrought in us and by us, with the omnipotent help and aſſiſtance of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:180666:172"/>We are called <hi>the trees of righteouſneſſe,</hi> Iſa. 61.3. <hi>and feare and love are fruits of righteouſneſs as wrought in us,</hi> Jer. 31. Hebr. 8.</p>
               <p>The 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Argument may be drawn from the oath of God. If God ſhould not performe this for the Saints, God ſhould be perjured (which is blaſphemy to ſpeak.) The oath of God binds him.

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 16. The reſurrection of Chriſt doth teach ſpirituall men to act purely in their new nature to the glory of their Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>As Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the glory of the Father; ſo we ſhould walke in newneſſe of life.</hi> To walk in newneſſe of life, is it to walk in the oldneſſe of that which is ſin or ſinfull? let any Spirituall man judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 17. We may draw another argument from the Kingly office of Chriſt. He as a King hath a command over his Subjects: but he hath not the command over us, when we doe that which is ſin or ſinfull, and therefore wee doe ſomething good as his Subjects in obedience to his commands <hi>(bona bene.)</hi> Good things muſt be done well. And therefore Chriſt doth not onely enable us to doe that which is righteous, but hee doth enable us to doe it righteouſly. Why is Chriſt King, but that we ſhould live under his commands? Why are we his ſubjects, why are we his ſervants, but becauſe wee are under his commands, and under his laws? You
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:180666:174"/>know; the Jewes ſaid they would not have Chriſt to be their King: but the voyce of every Chriſtian is to cry up Chriſt, to proclaime him King, and to owne him only as their Ruler. And Chriſt being King, rules and reigns in the hearts of his people by lawes and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and precious ſtatutes, worthy of ſuch a King.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt gives us not a law, as <hi>Moſes</hi> gave a law, that was grievous to thoſe that heard it: but Chriſt gives a law of love, a law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of ſweetneſſe, by which hee rules in the midſt of his enemies in our hearts; what is in the fleſh in us, is an enemie to Jeſus Chriſt: but Chriſt Jeſus ſitting upon his Throne as King, in our renewed, regenerated, and enlightned ſpirit, rules in the midſt of our ſins his enemies which oppoſe him.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is not ſuch a King as other Kings; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings make lawes, and adde penalties to their laws for thoſe that break them: but they have no power to enable their Subjects to keep them. But here is the priviledge and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of our King; when Chriſt makes lawes, he doth not only give us lawes, and bid us keepe them: but he hath power in himſelfe by which he enableth us to do that which he commands us to doe. If Chriſt ſhould command us to love, &amp; ſhould not enable us to doe that which
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:180666:174"/>he commands, he ſhould be ſuch a Law-giver as <hi>Moſes,</hi> that gave a Law, but gave no power to doe it: But Chriſt is not ſuch a Law-giver as <hi>Moſes.</hi> As he is not a rigid Law-giver, to bid Saints doe it upon penalty of damnation, or to worke for life, and ſalvation; ſo neither is he like <hi>Moſes,</hi> who could give them no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: but there is a power and ſtrength goes with Chriſts commands, to enable us to doe what Chriſt the King commands.</p>
               <p>Therefore if any of you give Chriſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his grace by believing that he hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed all your ſins by his death, be not diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſight of your corruptions. <hi>Fight the good fight of faith. Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</hi> Chriſt that commands you to obey his Father, will enable you to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his Father. Chriſt reignes in the hearts of his people, not only by making known to them the covenant of his owne grace, but by ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with ſtrength to doe his will. Lord give what thou commandeſt ſaid one, and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mand what thou wilt. Chriſt commands us what to doe, and gives us power to doe that which he commands. Such a King is Chriſt, that frees his people not onely from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of ſin, but from the power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin in their ſpirits, lives, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. <hi>Bleſſed be God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:180666:175"/>ye were the ſervants of ſin.</hi> Are they ſo ſtill, <hi>now they are under grace?</hi> No, <hi>but being made free from ſin, ye are the ſervants of righteouſneſſe? ſinne ſhall not have dominion over you;</hi> why? ye have a new King; ye are under grace, ye are under King Jeſus.</p>
               <p>If a Tyrant ſhould tyrannize over Subjects, and depoſe their lawfull King; if this King af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhould overthrow this Tyrant, and deliver his Subjects from tyranny and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, by overcomming the Tyrant, would hee ſuffer this Tyrant to tyrannize over them, or his people to be under the lawes of the Tyrant? We were under Satan the Tyrant, under his lawes and commands, under the law of ſinne and concupiſcence: but Chriſt comes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes the Tyrant that ruled tyrannically in our hearts; and will hee ſuffer that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſtill to rule us by thoſe commands, which he gave us when wee were in bondage to him? No, we ſhall not be under the bondage of the fleſh, if we underſtand the liberty of grace, and of the Spirit. The Apoſtle ſaith, that we doe not live, nor eate, nor drinke, nor doe any shing to our ſelves, becauſe <hi>Chriſt dyed, and roſe and revived, that he might be Lord of quicke and dead,</hi> Rom. 14.8, 9. Chriſt dyed, and roſe, that he might be Lord and King, and reigne, and ſet up his Scepter of holineſſe in the hearts of his people.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:180666:175"/>
               <p>This was propheſied in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> When Chriſt as King comes with power, his people ſhall be willing. Chriſt bids them believe, and they believe, he bids them love, and they doe love; they run through fire and water, they lay downe their honours and riches at his feet, and <hi>love not their lives unto the death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The enabling of Chriſt in working is not of the ſame extent with his command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the ſpirituall and regenerate part, the power of Chriſt is as large as his command. The fayling is not from the new, but the olde man. The whole man or perſon is under the command: ſo that a man, yea, every man doth ſin, becauſe he doth not doe in his perſon as he is a man, what is commanded. Charge the fault where it is to be charged upon the fleſh, which is the cauſe of a mans ſin, and then look upon grace which hath aboliſhed ſin, and you ſhall finde the new man <hi>conformable to the will of God,</hi> and the man good and holy in part, to wit, in his regenerated part. It is further obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that Chriſt biddeth us <hi>to cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> which no man doth. It is granted, and therefore we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not, but that every man ſinneth, if we take him phyſically. But as farre as we are in the Spirit, <hi>Wee are cleanſed from all filthineſſe of fleſh
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:180666:176"/>and ſpirit;</hi> ſo that the new man doth fulfill it, and Chriſt doth reign in him, though the fleſh prove a Traytor, and rebellious againſt his commands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 18. Another argument may be brought from the conſideration of the Image of Chriſt. If this were true, that all the works of the Saints were in their formalitie ſinne; this would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Image of Jeſus Chriſt were an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of unholineſſe, and ſin. I ground my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument upon that place of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Wee all with open face beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Here the Apoſtle ſhewes that the Saints are changed into the Image of Chriſt. Now if there were nothing but ſin and unholineſſe &amp; ſinfulneſſe in thoſe who are loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon as ſpirituall (as ſome conceive) it wil follow that the Image of Chriſt into which they are changed, muſt be an image of unholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. If my love be unholineſſe, I am changed to that image of love which is in Chriſt, and ſo it would follow, that the Image of Chriſt doth conſiſt in unholineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If there be perfect ſanctification in the new man, then wee may bee juſtified by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny that, it doth not follow. We
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:180666:176"/>ſhall have perfect ſanctification at the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and yet you will not ſay, that we ſhall be acquitted from our ſinnes by it, which wee have committed upon earth: but by the grace of God in the blood of Chriſt</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are juſtified before ſancification, and therefore it will not follow that we are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. Becauſe that is done before the other is wrought in us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That a man may be juſtified by his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. It is neceſſary that a man ſhould be ſo wholy ſanctified, that there ſhould be no ſin in the man. Our good works will not make ſatisfaction for our bad works. A Traytor for an act of treaſon might be condemned by his Prince, though he hath done him much good ſervice. If a man would ſeeke juſtification by the law, who is ſanctified in part, the law would condemn him for his ſin, in his unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated part, taking no notice of any ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in his ſanctification, to free him from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for his ſinne in the unregenerated part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 19. This opinion that the good works of the juſtified man are ſin, or ſinfull, do make divers places of Scripture irreconcileable. Men ſhall never be well able to reconcile many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture who ſwallow this as a trueth; that whatſoever workes are now done in the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:180666:177"/>Saints, are nothing but ſinne, or ſinfull. For inſtance in one place, we are bound to diſclaime our works, and to account all our righteouſneſſes <hi>as filthy ragges,</hi> to believe in him that juſtifieth the ungodly; And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place we are ſaid to be <hi>redeemed from all i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity, that we might be zealous of good workes,</hi> Tit. 2. <hi>And we are the work manſhip of God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in Chriſt Jeſus to good workes,</hi> Eph. 2. By what I have delivered, they are eaſily reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable. To wit, by diſtinguiſhing, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth concerning good works thus. That all the works of man under the Law, are but ſplendid and ſhining ſins: and that the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all workes of a ſpirituall man, are good, and not ſin or ſinfull in their nature.

               <p>I have known ſome profeſſors of the Goſpel who have fallen to <hi>Familiſme</hi> and Atheiſticall opinions: and being asked why they did leave the Goſpel? they have anſwered, that they could never reconcile the Scriptures concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing works, to other places, while they were profeſſors of the Goſpel. Their meaning is, while they were profeſſors upon theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by which they were taught to look upon the works of the ſpirit in them as ſin, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. That which is frequently aſſerted by ſome (Mr. <hi>Eatoon Honycomb</hi> and others) that they are good to men-ward, will not make up the breach. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>a meeke &amp; quiet ſpirit, which is the ornament of the hidden man of the heart,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that it is of great price in the ſight of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4.

He ſaith, <hi>that we receive what we aske, becauſe wee doe what is pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> I muſt profeſſe to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, that this diſtinction hath given me a great light in the underſtanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And by this I am informed, that I am juſtified without holineſs or ſanctification, and yet that <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 20. This opinion that the good worke of a man born of God are ſin, or ſinfull, doth overthrow the diſtinction which is warranted by many thouſand places of Scripture between good works and bad works, and doth draw a curſe upon the doer of it. Can evill be good, or good evill? <hi>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evill; that put darkneſſe for light, and light for darkeneſſe; that put bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter,</hi> Iſa. 5.20.

Where hee informeth us of the condition of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> before converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit, that they were thieves, adultereſſes, and the like, <hi>ſuch were ſome of you;</hi> and then ſetteth forth their bleſſed condition after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And doth ſecond this truth with his owne experience, acknowledging that there was a real change wrought in himſelf after converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſanctification, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>I was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a perſecuter, a blaſphemer, injurious: but the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith &amp; love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> not with faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but love alſo.</p>

For as the Spirit is holy formally in it ſelfe, in its owne nature, eſſence, and being: ſo it is effectively holy, becauſe it makes that man holy, who was formerly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. If thou be nothing but darkneſſe, if God convert thee, thou wilt have a glorious light in thine underſtanding: if thou have nothing but unholineſſe in thy will, if the Spirit of

As the Pſalmiſt ſaith. <hi>Thy Spirit is good, lead me into the land of holineſſe and uprightneſſe.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that doe not find that Spirit leading them into the paths and wayes of holineſſe, thoſe men have received a counterfeit ſpirit to delude them, and not the true Spirit of the Lord Jeſus.</p>

There may bee another argument drawne from that place of the Apoſtle, when hee ſaith, <hi>The Spirit beareth witneſſe with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God,</hi> Rom. 8.16. The Spirit cannot beare witneſſe to our old, darke, prophane ſpirits: for the naturall man <hi>receives not the things of the Spirit, for they are fooliſhneſſe to him;</hi> therefore it muſt be to our ſpirit enlightned, renewed, and filled with the Spirit of God.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:180666:180"/>that which is done in faith, is not ſin. If we deny this we ſhall take away the difference between doing good works in faith, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good works without faith, if both of them be alike ſinfull or ſinne. And therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the work of the Spirit which is done in faith, is not ſin. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God;</hi> and therefore by faith it is poſſible to pleaſe him by doing good works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 25. Another argument may be drawn from that place, 2 Cor. 13. where the Apoſtle makes the compariſon betweene <hi>faith, hope, and love,</hi> and prefers love before faith &amp; hope for this reaſon; becauſe love is more perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and of longer continuance than faith, and hope; when a man comes to heaven, hee ceaſeth to live the life of faith; for then he ſhall live the life of ſight, and viſion: he ceaſeth to hope, for he enjoyeth that, which he hoped for: but love ſhall continue. Therefore he ſaith, that love, (that is the fruit of faith) is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than faith in reſpect of its continuance. That which remaines and endures after this life in the Saints in glory, is not ſin: but love ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, and endure after this life, therefore it is not ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome ſay, if you looke on this place and take notice of this character and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of love, you will ſcarce find any man
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:180666:181"/>in the world that hath ſuch a love; and by your argument no true faith. For hee ſaith <hi>that love ſuffereth long, it envieth not, it vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not it ſelfe, it is not puffed up, behaveth not it ſelfe unſeemely, ſeeketh not her owne, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evill, rejoyceth not in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but rejoyceth in the truth: beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</hi> Love never faileth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Every man that is borne of God hath ſuch a love as farre as he is born of God. I ſay not that he hath it in the fleſh, in the old man, but in the new man. Wee have a new man, as we have an old man; and as wee are ſometimes acted by the new man, ſo ſometimes by the old man. As wee are acted by the olde man, we doe nothing but that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this love: but as far as we are acted in the Spirit by the new man, by the power of God, and the grace of Chriſt; ſo far we have ſuch a love as is here ſet downe. Therefore if any man hath not ſuch a love, and hath beene perſwaded that hee hath true faith, I dare preach it in the name of Chriſt, that that man never had true faith: for true faith works by ſuch love as the Apoſtle deſcribes here. And he poſitively ſaith, that if a man have other gifts, and ſuch a faith <hi>by which hee can remove mountaines, and hath not this love, that he is nothing.</hi>

And if upon examination thou ſhalt finde that thou haſt not ſuch a love, I ſay thou art a ſtranger to God: <hi>For hee that knoweth God walks in love. He that ſaith he knoweth God, and walkes not in love, he knoweth not God. God is love, and he that dwelleth in God, dwelleth in love,</hi> 1 Ep. John.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould preach the Doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and write volumes of it, yet if I find after all this, that I am without this love, I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>If I ſpeake with the tongue of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; If I could propheſie, and had all faith to remove mountaines, yet if I have not love, I am but as ſounding braſſe, and a tinckling Cymball.</hi> Hee that loves God, by apprehending Gods love, he cannot but love God again, and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yea enemy, for Gods ſake. Therefore if a man ſay, I have been a profeſſor of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but finde not love to God &amp; Chriſt, and my enemies for Chriſts ſake. It is as if hee ſhould ſay, Sir I have been a profeſſor of grace many yeares, and have been looked on as one that knowes Chriſt: but I know him not, for I have not true love that accompanies true faith.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 26. God ſpeaking of faith, love, fear,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:180666:182"/>zeal, &amp; the like, as in us, doth promiſe to be the worker of them in us; and therefore if theſe ſhould be ſin, the fault would be chargable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. I would have this argument to be wel weighed, becauſe it anſwereth the ordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, to wit, that theſe fruits are good, and no way faulty as in the precept of God, but not as wrought in us. God is the Author of them by promiſe, as they are wrought in us, which will make him the Author of ſinne, if they be ſin or ſinfull. If faith and love is ſinne, then he hath Covenanted to work ſin in thee: for hee hath covenanted to worke feare and love in thee. But farre be it from us to have ſuch a thought of our holy God. If God work feare in our hearts, that feare ſhall not be ſin, or ſinfull. We know the excellency of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, or work-man, by the aedifice or build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and doe judge what worke-man God is by his glorious work in the ſpirits of the Saints: and if God worke onely ſinfull things in us, what worke-man would we conclude him to be? <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>by the grace of God, I am what I am,</hi> 2 Cor. 15. It is by grace that I love, it is by grace that I feare with a filiall feare; it is by grace that I am zealous for God: If this love were ſin, if this feare were ſin, if this zeale were ſinne, wee might lay the fault upon the worke-man; It is Gods work, not ours, but

The ſpirit, and the things of the ſpirit like oyle ſwimming upon the ſurface of the waters, doth not change it ſelfe into the nature of the fleſh.

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. <hi>Paul</hi> was a regenerated man, yet he confeſſeth that he <hi>was not able to performe that which is good,</hi> Rom. 7.18. Therefore no rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man is able to performe that which is good.</p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:180666:183"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Paul</hi> doth give a ſufficient anſwer to this objection in the preceding words of the ſame verſe, where he ſaith, <hi>in me (that is in my fleſh) dwelleth no good thing,</hi> by which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he ſpeaketh of himſelfe in reference to his fleſh. And this is a truth, which with all the faithfull I willingly ſubſcribe unto. But when he plainely ſpeaketh of a man in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, freed from the clouds of temptations, and power of the fleſh, in the laſt verſe of the ſame Chapter, he ſaith, <hi>With the minde I my ſelf ſerve the law of God: but with the fleſh the law of ſin.</hi> It is good to ſerve the law of God: but <hi>Paul</hi> in the Spirit had attained unto this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> was enabled to performe that which is good. According to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>It is God, who worketh in us to will and to doe of his owne good pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Arg. 2. <hi>There is none that doth good, no not one,</hi> Rom. 3.9, 10, 11. which is meant aſwell of the regenerate, as unregenerate, as is evident by <hi>verſ.</hi> 23, 24. becauſe it is meant of all who are juſtified freely by his grace, as appears fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the inſtances of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> which were regenerated, <hi>Ch.</hi> 4.2.6.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is plain that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here of a man under the law, and of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate

Hee ſaith, <hi>that none ſeeketh after God;</hi> can you affirme this of a regenerated man? when the ſame Prophet, who in the 14. <hi>Pſame</hi> doth give us a character of a wicked man: out of which this is taken in the 24. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> doth give us this character of a man <hi>truly godly,</hi> that hee is <hi>one of the generation of thoſe who ſeeke God.</hi> 2.

               <p>Again ſecondly, you would prove it by this
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:180666:184"/>argument, becauſe hee ſpeaketh of all thoſe who are juſtified. But let me tell you, that we muſt diſtinguiſh of a man before and after his Juſtification. Every man is ſuch a man before Juſtification, and in this reſpect he ſpeaketh of all men: but after juſtification there is a charge wrought in a man, as I have formerly proved at large; unto which I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>But thirdly you inſtance in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> who were regenerated men.</p>

The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Juſtification, and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſanctification. Of the firſt of theſe the Prophet ſpeaking, ſaith, <hi>that a man is bleſſed to whom ſin is not imputed,</hi> of the latter where hee ſaith of the ſame verſe. <hi>And in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile;</hi> which the learned <hi>Zanchius</hi> doth apprehend to be ſpoken in reference to that ſanctification which is in the unregenerated part, underſtand the diſtinction rightly, and you cannot want an anſwer to this Objection.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Wee believe not ſo ſtedfaſtly, nor love ſo perfectly as we ought, therefore is our faith &amp; love imperfect, and ſinfull. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If we ſhould grant the antecedent, we may deny the conſequence. It is true, that if a man doth not believe ſo ſtedfaſtly, and love ſo perfectly as he
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:180666:185"/>ought, that then the man doth ſin, conſider him phyſically. And this wee have alwayes granted: but it doth not follow, that his faith and love is ſin, but that which is in the fleſh is ſin, which is the cauſe that he doth not believe ſo ſtedfaſtly, and love ſo perfectly as he ought. <hi>Ameſius</hi> doth give a ſufficient anſwer to this in anſwering an argument which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth bring againſt the Proteſtants, to wit, that ſins doe not pleaſe God in Chriſt. It is true, ſaith he, that ſin doth not pleaſe God: but the ſtain of ſin being done away, the good which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth is pleaſing unto God. (<hi>Sane quidem certe, ſedpeccati maculâ in Chriſto deletâ, bonum ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratum placet.</hi> Tom. 4. l. 6. c. 8.)</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. We ſay that a regenerate man looked upon in the new Covenant, doth believe ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly, and love perfectly. His unbeliefe and hatred of God which is in the fleſh, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the rich mantle of Gods grace and mercy: as far as he doth believe truly, he doth believe ſtedfaſtly; and as far as he doth love, he doth love perfectly. Let not this offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man that I ſay he doth love perfectly. It is granted by moſt Proteſtant writers, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man hath a perfection of parts, though not of degrees. A childe may have an humane nature, and the parts of a man, as well as a man of forty yeares old. A ſparke of fire
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:180666:185"/>hath the true nature of fire, a drop of water hath the nature of water in it, as wel as all the water in the Sea. So a ſparke or drop of love, hath the divine nature of love in it, as well as that which burnes in the breaſts of a Seraphim, and therefore is not ſin or ſinfull. And for this reaſon it is ſaid that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not weak in faith, though it is unqueſtionable that hee had his weakneſſe in the fleſh, as well as other men, and that hee ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God, through unbelief: <hi>but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God,</hi> Rom. 4. And this is the meaning likewiſe of <hi>Ameſius</hi> in the place for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly cited, where hee ſaith, That the good works of the faithfull are not only good by the object of them, but in reference to all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of them, the efficient, materiall, formall, and finall cauſe. <hi>(Opera fidelium, non tantum ſunt bona ex objecto, ſed etiam quoad omnes cauſas efficientem, materiam, formam et finem.)</hi>

It is ſaid, <hi>that our Saviour encreaſed in wiſdome,</hi> Luk. 2.52. will you ſay that his wiſedome was ſinfull at firſt, becauſe he did encreaſe and grow in it? You may as well ſay ſo, as conclude that our ſanctification is ſinne or ſinfull, becauſe it doth grow or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to a greater perfection.</p>

But <hi>Paul</hi> and every true Saint being juſtified by faith without them, doth dare to bring them in the preſence of God as ſecondary evidences of Gods love to him.

His Propheticall office; <hi>For whom ſhould he teach?</hi> the new man needs not his teaching, ſeeing he with all his works is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perfect, and can be no otherwiſe. The olde man is not capable of his teaching.</p>

               <p>Firſt, in his Kingly office, the glory of a king doth lye in ſubduing his enemies. And in this
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:180666:187"/>the glory of Chriſt conſidered as a King, doth appeare that hee doth vanquiſh the enemies of us his Subjects, by ruling in our hearts with his Scepter of righteouſneſſe. According to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>that hee ſhall rule in the midſt of his enemies.</hi> By this wee ſee his regall power over the old man. Again, the glory of a King is wrapt up in the willing obedience of his Subjects, and this is made good in the new man. <hi>His people being made willing in the day of his power.</hi> For what is here objected, that the new man needs not the government of Chriſt? It is as if one ſhould ſay, that a man doth make void and overthrow royall government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he maintaineth, that the Kings Subjects are willingly obedient unto him. But you ſay that they are perfect, and therefore his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is needleſſe. <hi>The ſpirits of juſt men are made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12. And will you therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the government of Chriſt over them is needleſſe? But to paſſe this by. 2. It will appeare that the Prieſtly office of Chriſt, is not overthrown, but eſtabliſhed rather by this doctrine; for firſt, we hold that no man liveth as a new man, who doth live under the guilt of ſin, and therefore by the eye of the new man wee are daily to looke upon Chriſt as a Prieſt, in whom is no finne; <hi>who by one offering hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:180666:188"/>Heb. 10.14. Again, the Prieſt was to offer up the ſacrifices of the people for them, and by this doctrine we eſtabliſh Chriſt in his Prieſtly office, which we could not do if we ſhould ſay, that there were nothing in us but what is ſinne and ſinfull in us. The people were to bring ſomething which was good to be offered up by the Prieſt to God. <hi>The blinde, lame, and ſicke were not to be offered unto God,</hi> Mal. 1.8. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that which we doe, that is ſin or ſinfull, offered up by Jeſus Chriſt to the Father, but that which is good. And thus wee eſtabliſh Chriſt in his Prieſtly office, by affirming that there is ſomething good in the new man, which is the matter of acceptance. 3. Wee doe not overthrow his Propheticall office by this truth. For he doth daily teach us in the new man. Whereas you ſay that he needs not his teaching; wee ſay that the new man hath his dependance upon Chriſt, for wiſedome, knowledg, and underſtanding. And as a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lampe doth daily ſtand in need of oyle to be powred into it for the maintaining of the light thereof; ſo we ſay that a Chriſtian doth daily ſtand in need of ſpiritual oyle to be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into his ſoule by Jeſus Chriſt, that he may ſhine forth in the light of truth. Will you dare to ſay that the ſoules of the Juſt, made perfect, have no need of the teaching of Chriſt, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:180666:188"/>that they have no dependance upon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are perfect? Againe, it is neceſſary in reſpect of the old man, who is filled with helliſh darkneſſe &amp; ignorance, that Chriſt be looked upon as the great Prophet, that wee may put off the ignorance which is in him, &amp; may be more in the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>which will lead us into all truth.</hi> It being the way of Gods working to ſhine into our dark hearts, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them with the knowledge of his grace in Jeſus Chriſt. You may begin to ſee by what hath been delivered, that this doctrine doth not overthrow the offices of Jeſus Chriſt, but doth ſweetly to the glory of his Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm him in them.</p>

But we are ſpeaking of workes done and accepted under a Covenant of grace. The principall cauſe of mens errour and miſtake in this controverſie, is, becauſe they examine the new man and his workes, by the law of works, and not by the law of ſanctification, holineſſe and love in the new Covenant of grace. If wee did examine his workes by the law of holineſſe which is in the new covenant, we ſhould plainly perceive that it is by the Spirit of grace that his workes are freely wrought in him; and by this means all legall glorying, and carnall boaſting is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. According to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> And, <hi>what haſt thou, that thou didſt not receive?</hi> Now <hi>if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it.</hi> By which you may plainly ſee, that the argument will not hold good; to ſay that if a man work perfectly under a covenant of grace, that his reward is not of grace but of debt. I ſhal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give you a ſhort anſwer to the firſt part of this argument, by diſtinguiſhing of a two-fold working, 1. under a law of works, and there it is true, that if a man worke perfectly, his
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:180666:189"/>reward is of debt. 2. Under a covenant of grace where a mans ſin is freely forgiven him, and by free grace he is enabled to worke righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly: and there his reward is not of debt to ſpeak properly, but of grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though we deny that God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth any reward to a ſpirituall man as a debt due unto him, for his merits and deſervings; yet wee affirme that God giveth rewards to a ſpirituall man who doth good works. And therefore it is ſaid that Chriſt commeth with his reward with him, <hi>to give every man as his worke ſhall be,</hi> Revel. 22.12. <hi>And</hi> Moſe <hi>eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Aegypt: for he had reſpect unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward,</hi> Hebr. 11.26. And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward may be called a debt, not in reference to mans merrit, but in reference to Gods promiſe of grace; as a man by his promiſe may make himſelf a debter to a beggar. And therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking unto the Saints, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.10. ſaith, <hi>That God is not unrighteous to forget the worke of the Saints, and labour of love.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> exhorteth us, <hi>that wee loſe not thoſe things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward,</hi> 2 John. And in this ſenſe ſomething may be given unto us as a reward of that work of grace, which is given unto us before it. Our confidence in Gods grace may have a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:180666:190"/>in this reſpect. According to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35. <hi>Caſt not away your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which hath great recompence of reward.</hi> And this may be an anſwer to the ſecond part of this argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. If the workes of the regenerate be not evill, becauſe the holy Ghoſt worketh them. Then the works of the unregenerate, as his love and obedience to his parents are not evill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a generall concurrence of God as the prime cauſe in the doing of ſome things by wicked men, and thus God may concur to the doing of a thing, &amp; yet the thing as done by the wicked man may be evill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not done in faith. And it is no ſolid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to conclude from hence God did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the doing of this thing, and therefore it is not ſin or ſinfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. There is a ſpeciall concurrence of Gods grace and Spirit in the doing of a thing, as hee is the principall agent in working good ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in the Saints who are under a covenant of grace. And when God doth concur w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the ſpeciall &amp; powerfull aſſiſtance of his grace for the effecting of a thing in a Saint, it is ſafe to draw a concluſion to prove the goodneſſe of the thing, from the conſidering of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall agent which did concurre in the doing of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:180666:190"/>the thing. As <hi>John</hi> doth in theſe words, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that a ſpirituall man conſidered as a ſpirituall man, and acting as a ſpirituall man, <hi>cannot ſin, becauſe his ſeed remaineth in him.</hi> By which diſtinction you may ſee the weakneſs of your argument (with which you would prove the unſoundneſſe of my arguing from God, conſidered as the principal agent to the effect.) And the diſparity of Gods working in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and unregenerate. When God doth work in a ſpirituall man that which is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, it is not only good ſubſtantially and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially, but formally and circumſtantially by the grace of God, as I have proved at large. And therefore this argument is not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to overthrow what hath beene delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 11. Either the holy Ghoſt workes the works of the regenerate man wholly, as the ſole cauſe, and then it is not wee but the holy Ghoſt that believes, that loves, that fears God, that repents, that prayes for the forgiveneſſe of his ſin, &amp;c. which were abſurd to imagine, or elſe we alſo work with him in ſome kind of cauſality to the producing of thoſe workes, that ſo the works may be ſaid to be ours, our loving, our fearing, our rejoycing, our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If ſo, then are we in this working, either perfect or imperfect Agents. If perfect agents,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:180666:191"/>then is there no ignorance in our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, no depravation in our wills, no perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in our affections. The contrary whereof, all the truly faithfull find by experience, and the Scripture abundantly teſtifieth. But if we be imperfect agents, then cannot perfection come out of imperfection, no effect can be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than its cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 The efficiency of the firſt cauſe, doth not take away the efficiency of the ſecond cauſe. <hi>In God we live &amp; move,</hi> yet it is not God that moveth; he, though he moveth all things, cannot be moved himſelf (<hi>immobilis, movens om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> Aug.) So it is not God that repenteth, but we repent. The ignorance of which truth hath been the cauſe of the wicked miſtery of <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſme</hi> which my ſoule abhorreth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall agree in the truth, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely laid down in the firſt part of your Dilemma.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Whereas you ſay that all the faithfull grant, that man is an imperfect agent. I anſwer, that if we take perfect here in this point, as it is oppoſed to that which is ſinfull, ſo many Saints doe grant, and all ſhould and will, as more light is beamed into their ſoules, grant it, that the ſanctified and ſpiritual man, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as farre forth as he is a ſpirituall man, doth work as a perfect Agent, not as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:180666:191"/>but an holy man. And therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your rule, his action muſt be ſpirituall and holy. And this may give an anſwer to that argument which is brought from <hi>Job, Who can bring a cleane thing out of an uncleane,</hi> Job 14.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Whereas you ſay, that no effect can be better than its cauſe, &amp;c. This is not univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true. A man imperfect by the want of his armes or legs may beget a childe which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and hath its limbs. But this not being much to the purpoſe, I ſhall not contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 12. If the new man never ſin, Chriſt came not to ſave the new man, <hi>for he came only to ſave ſinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The new man taken in this ſpirituall and theologicoll ſence is not the object of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: but an elect perſon guilty and ſinfull in himſelfe. And the new creation is a bleſſed conſequent of our redemption by Chriſt: but I have ſufficiently anſwered this before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 13. That which is not in its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture agreeable to the holy law of God, is not perfect, and without ſin; <hi>for ſin is the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or diſagreement with the law of God,</hi> 1 John 3.4. But the beſt of a regenerate mans actions are not agreeable to the law of God, being not done <hi>with all the heart, with all the ſoule, with
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:180666:192"/>all the underſtanding, and with all the ſtrength,</hi> Mat. 22.37. Deut. 6.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. By this argument you would bring the ſpirituall man to judge himſelfe by the law or old covenant: but hee is better taught by the Spirit. And as hee doth not put his perſon under the old covenant, ſo doth he not judge his actions by the old covenant, but by the new covenant of grace. According to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.18. <hi>If ye are led by the Spirit ye are not under the law.</hi> And thus looking upon what is wrought by the Spirit under the new covenant, he ſeeth it in its own nature agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the law as it is delivered unto him in the hand of the Lord Jeſus. Not that Chriſt doth require leſſe holineſſe than is required in the old covenant: but becauſe he giveth us more grace, enabling us to keepe his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; by the keeping of which, we known in the light of the Spirit that we truly know him. And the Commandements of Chriſt are kept by the Saints Evangelically two manner of wayes. 1. By believing for juſtification. 2. By holy walking for ſanctification; not that we can keep them by holy walking, but as we walk in the light of our juſtification. And thus he is as well able to keep the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of love, as the commandement of faith. Suppoſe a King ſhould pardon a Traytor, and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:180666:192"/>ſhould give him an aſſurance of pardon for all future Treaſon which he might run into, and had power to enable him in ſome things, and ſometimes to be obedient unto him as a loyall Subject, would you not ſay that this Subject were a loyall Subject; all his trayterous acts forgiven, and his loyall obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Soveraigne being accepted? Thus it is between God and us: He forgiveth all the treaſons of the fleſh, and accepteth of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the ſpirit. God doth account that all the commands of the Law are fulfilled by us, when that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is not done is pardoned. <hi>(Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia tunc facta deputantur, cum id quod non fit ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcitur.)</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is true in a ſenſe in reference to ſanctification as well as to juſtification. And a ſpirituall man thus looking upon himſelfe in the glaſſe of the covenant of grace, doth know that he is a keeper of the Commandements of God; and can ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.10. <hi>With my whole heart I have ſought thee: O let me not wander from thy Commandements.</hi> All his defects and imperfections with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of evil, and omitting good in the fleſh are done away, and that which is good is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſo by the law of God, as it is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him in this Covenant. <hi>So ſpeake ye, and ſo doe, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty</hi> ſaith <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 2.12. As God doth
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:180666:193"/>judge our perſons by the law of liberty, or the law of the new Covenant, ſo he doth judg our actions, and thus they are perfect. And the law of the new Covenant is not only faith for juſtification, but love for ſanctification. And thus this place is expounded by the learned <hi>Paraeus.</hi>

Which doth appear by what followeth in the 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> of the ſame Chap. where he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the Saints in this ſence to be perfect, with which verſe I ſhall put a period to my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to your objections. <hi>As many as be perfect be thus minded, &amp; if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveale even this unto you.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. The leſſons which God hath taught me from theſe meditations, have beene very powerfull by his grace for the convincing mee of ſin in a Goſpel-way; and for the humbling of my ſoule under his mighty hand, by ſeeing
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:180666:193"/>the huge maſſe of corruption which is in the fleſh, &amp; that little quantity of pure gold which is in the Spirit. It was the ſpeech of one of the Ancients, that grace in ſome Saints is like a ſpark in the Ocean. And thus I have appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it in my ſelfe: Yet I ſee that as it is wrought by grace, ſo it is accepted by grace, being not under the law as delivered in the firſt covenant, and yet not <hi>without the law to God, but under the law to Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.21. And this hath been a ſtrong motive unto mee to hunger and thirſt after the righteouſneſſe of ſanctification, commanded and promiſed in the new Covenant, which doth comfort mee with an aſſurance and confidence, that that which is perfected here in part inchoatively, ſhall be perfected in degrees conſummatively. I can ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 138.8. <hi>The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me, he will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the works of his owne hand.</hi> And ſeeing the ſtrength and power of the fleſh in mee, I am carried up in ſpirit, to admire and wonder at Gods omnipotent grace, by which, through faith, which worketh by love, <hi>I am preſerved together with all Saints unto the day of ſalvation in Chriſt Jeſus, who is over all</hi> (Rom. 9.5.) <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE beliefe of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a preſent comfort in the midſt of miſery. <hi>Reſurrectio mortuorum, fiducia Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norun, Tertul.</hi> The reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the dead is the joy, confidence, and boaſting of Chriſtians. And therefore when the people of God had made a ſad complaint of their low condition, in the words preceding my Text: our Evangelicall Prophet, for their comfort, and conſolation, doth from the mouth of God preſent them with this ſweet and precious promiſe of a glorious reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180666:195"/>of their bodies. Let poore Saints bee full of complaints, let the billowes of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and trouble be ready to overwhelme their ſoules; and let God but breake in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſpirits, and give them aſſurance of a bleſſed reſurrection by his grace; and all their trouble, all their diſcomforts, all their miſeries, by the light of this Sunne, will preſently vaniſh away.</p>
               <p>You may read the complaint in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>verſe,</hi> where the Church complaines that ſhe had been like a woman with child, in great paine, <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>Like as a woman with Child that draweth neere the time of her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is in paine, and crieth out in her pangs; ſo have we been in thy ſight, O Lord;</hi> We know the paines of a woman in travell, are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt paines; and the Church to ſet forth her trouble, compares it to the paines and pangs of a woman in travell.</p>
               <p>But that which doth heighten the trouble and miſery of the Church is this, that though ſhe were thus like a woman in travell, and paine; and expected to bring forth ſome great thing, and to doe ſomething in the world which might be left as a laſting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to the praiſe of God: and be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment to her ſelfe after her throwes and languiſhment. She finds that all was a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180666:195"/>falſe conception; therefore ſhe ſaith in the next verſe, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 18.) <hi>We have been with child, we have been in paine, we have as it were brought forth the wind.</hi> She ſwelled big with expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thought ſhe ſhould have brought forth ſome glorious birth into the world: but alas all that <hi>ſhe hath</hi> brought forth, hath been but as it were wind; we ſee nothing but a falſe conception, <hi>We have not wrought any deliverance in the Earth, neither have the Inhabitants of the world fallen, ver.</hi> 18. Here wee ſee the ſad complaint of the Church.</p>
               <p>And in the words I have read to you, you may likewiſe read the Prophet laying downe that which might comfort, and cheare the ſad and drouping ſpirits of the people of God, in this ſad, and lamentable complaint of theirs; And that is drawne from a ſweet promiſe, that God makes to them of a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: as if the Prophet had ſaid, let it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trouble you, though you be the pooreſt, vileſt, and miſerableſt creatures here upon the Earth: looke beyond the Earth, looke for the accompliſhment of Gods promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this preſent life; and then you ſhall ſee as much cauſe to rejoyce, as you apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded cauſe of mourning before; What though you doe no great thing for the preſent on Earth; what though your Enemies prevaile
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180666:196"/>over you; what though their curſed devices, Counſells, and Machinations doe take effect againſt you: what though you fall by their hands, and can doe no great things to ſet up Trophees of glory below? remember this, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe,</hi> &amp;c. Thus you ſee what coherence theſe words have with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</p>
               <p>In the words be pleaſed to take notice of theſe parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, here is a promiſe made to the people of God, of a bleſſed reſurrection. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the confirmation of this, that is, (as ſome interpret it) from the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>My dead body ſhall riſe,</hi> therefore they ſhall not lye long in the duſt: <hi>together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe,</hi> or elſe thus, if wee leave out [<hi>together,</hi> and <hi>with,</hi>] which are not in the Originall, then this is the meaning. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, my dead body ſhall they ariſe;</hi> at the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſhall riſe as my very dead body. I have conſulted with the Hebrew text, and I find no more but that, I ſee no reaſon wee ſhould put in <hi>together with,</hi> ſeeing it is not found in the firſt copy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the nature of the reſurrection is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180666:196"/>expreſſed to us, <hi>Awake.</hi> The Saints doe (as it were) awake out of their ſleep: Death is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſleep to the people of God. The Prophet here to take away the ſharpneſſe and bitterneſſe of death, compares it to a bed, wherein a man ſweetly repoſeth himſelfe, and after he is refreſhed riſeth out againe: ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Saints have layne a while in their beds, in their graves, they awake, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>As for mee, I will behold thy face in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>ult.</hi> that is, at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; when I awake, then I ſhall be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thy likeneſſe; I doe not enjoy ſo much of thee here as I deſire to doe: but then when I awake, I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, here is the great joy ſet forth that ſhall be when the Saints doe ariſe, and that is expreſſed in that they are bid to <hi>Awake and ſing:</hi> When the Saints are raiſed, they are to have a ſong in their mouthes, of joy, and the glory of God in their hearts; <hi>awake, and ſing.</hi> But it is otherwiſe with wicked, and ungodly ones; they muſt awake, and houle; they muſt awake, when they had rather ſleepe an everlaſting ſleep, and wiſh it might be a continuall, and an ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during midnight to their poore ſoules: but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180666:197"/>for the Saints, they are to awake and ſing.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we have the Saints ſet forth to us in their low condition, before this reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo they are called the Inhabitants of the duſt, <hi>Awake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, we have a further proofe, that there ſhall be ſuch a glorious reſurrection, and that there ſhall be ſuch great joy in the hearts of theſe Inhabitants of the duſt, when they are raiſed by the power of Heaven from death to immortall life; and that is, from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly dew, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which ſhall be as dew from the Father upon them, to quicken them to life after death: For as we ſee the dew of Heaven falling upon the herbs after they are withered, and almoſt dead by the parching heat of the Sunne, they againe waxe green, and flouriſh: ſo when we have laine withering in the grave, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be as the dew of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon us; be ſhall come downe in his power, and put a new life into us, and after death we ſhall be raiſed to a life of glory: <hi>for thy dew is as the dew of herbs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then in the next place he proves it from the willingneſſe of the Earth, to be disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened of her charge when God calls for it, the Earth ſhall preſently give up the carkaſſes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180666:197"/>that ſhe hath received in. The earth is Gods Cheſt, in which he locks up the duſt of his Saints for a ſhort time: but when God calls for this treaſure againe, the earth ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be willing to yeild what was intruſted to her bowells. <hi>And the Earth ſhall caſt up her dead.</hi> Theſe are the parts of this text: which is as cleare a promiſe concerning the reſurrection of the dead, as we find in all the Old-Teſtament, though others doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expound it concerning the <hi>Jewes</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, with whom I have not time now to contend.</p>
               <p>I did make choice of this text for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe I did conſider, that though there be many that make profeſſion of Chriſt, and of a reſurrection; yet there are few that believe in Chriſt, or that believe the truth of the reſurrection: Durſt men live in all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, ungodlineſſe, and impiety? durſt they venture to carry the load of their ſins with them to the grave when they come to lie on their death-beds? and never be troubled for their ſinnes, never be troubled for their goods unjuſtly gotten? were it poſſible that men could livethus, and die in this ſottiſh and ſenſleſſe condition, did they indeed, and in truth believe there were a reſurrection?</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:180666:198"/>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe I have met with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe people in the Citie, who doe with boldneſſe oppoſe the truth of the Doctrine of the reſurrection. Truly we need not goe to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we need not travel to the holy Land to find out a generation of <hi>Sadduces:</hi> the Lord knowes my heart hath bled within me, when I have conſidered the multitude of <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces</hi> that are here in <hi>London; Sadduces</hi> of all ſorts: Epiſcopall <hi>Sadduces,</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces;</hi> ſeparated <hi>Sadduces,</hi> dipt <hi>Sadduces,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Sadduces;</hi> yet all agree in this notion, that it is a meere fancy of man, a notion of ſome idle braine, that there ſhall be a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of bodies at the great day of the Lord Jeſus. I believe that the truth of this is ſo generally knowne, that there is not one thinks that I ſpeak an untruth in this place at this preſent. For impiety hath gotten ſuch a brazen face, that it comes forth in the light, and though men have profeſſed Chriſt, and Religion, and the Doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſo long: yet how many are there now that denie that ever Chriſt came in the fleſh? or that there ſhall be a reſurrection of bodies at the great day? Therefore I thought I was bound in Conſcience, (if I would deale uprightly in imploying that ſmall talent God hath given me) to manifeſt my diſlike of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:180666:198"/>theſe men, and to witneſſe againſt them in the behalfe of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſidering the ſubtle practiſes, and indefatigable labours of theſe people who under a vizard of Religion, deceive poore, weake Chriſtians; for their ſakes and for the ſatisfying of the weak, I did reſolve with my ſelfe to ſpeake ſomething, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Doctrine of the reſurrection: And ſeeing God hath preſſed me to the handling of this point; knowing it may be for the good of diverſe poore weak Chriſtians; I hope it will not be diſpleaſing to any who are truly ſpirituall, and know the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in a true and ſpirituall way, and waite upon him for the reſurrection of their bodies. I ſhall therefore without any further Preface addreſſe my ſelfe to the words of the Text.
<q>Thy dead men ſhall live.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Where we are to take notice, that though in this place here is nothing ſpoken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reſurrection of wicked men, but onely of the dead men of the Lord Jeſus, yet in other places it is ſufficiently held forth. Thoſe that dye in the faith, are in a ſpeciall manner called the dead men of God and of Chriſt, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord:</hi> and theſe are called in this reſpect

                  <hi>Chryſ.</hi>] the dreadfull Tribunall of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to give account for all their thoughts, words, and actions; yet you ſhall ſee other places clearly holding forth the reſurrection of the ungodly and wicked, as well as of the Saints, though here the Prophet ſpeaks onely of the reſurrection of thoſe that die in the Lord Jeſus. I will give you but one place, and that is in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.28, 29. It is the ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>Marvell not at this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for the houre is comming, in the which all that are in the graves ſhall heare my voyce, and ſhall come forth; thoſe that have done good</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>unto the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, and they that have done evill unto the reſurrection of damnation, Jo.</hi> 5.29. So that there is a twofold reſurrection, of life, and of damnation, though the Prophet ſpeak onely of the former in this place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live,</hi> that is, all thoſe Saints who die, and whoſe bodies
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:180666:199"/>are laid in the duſt, all thoſe ſhall riſe; God hath not appointed, that all the Saints ſhall die: this the Apoſtle ſhewes, <hi>We ſhall not all die, but we ſhall all be changed,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. And ſpeaking of thoſe that ſhall live when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall appeare from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he ſaith, <hi>then we which are alive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the ayre, and ſo we ſhall ever be with the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.17. So that when he ſaith, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live,</hi> that is, all thoſe Saints that ſhall die, ſhall live againe by the power of Chriſt, who ſhall be their life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth not ſpeak here of a reſurrection of ſoules: but when he ſaith <hi>Thy dead men,</hi> he meanes onely the bodies of the Saints. As our age hath been fertile to bring forth all mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous tenents and opinions that other ages have exploded; ſo it hath brought forth this abominable errour which many Heathens by the dimme light of nature have oppoſed, that the ſoule is mortall. They that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with people here in this City, will meet with ſome that will affirme, that the ſoule as well as the body is mortall; and this is one of the places that they make uſe of, <hi>Thy dead men.</hi> Now they ſay man is a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:180666:200"/>
                  <hi>compoſitum</hi> of ſoule, and body: therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead men muſt live, it followes that the ſoule, or humane ſpirit as well as the body muſt die.</p>
               <p>But conſider, this is againſt other places of Scripture; doth not the wiſe man tell us of the <hi>body returning to the duſt, and the ſpirit returning to God that gave it? Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. Doth not <hi>Paul deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt? Phil.</hi> 1 23. It is evident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he had a perſwaſion, that as ſoon as his ſpirit did take leave of his body, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould be happy in the enjoyment of the Lord Jeſus. Doth not our Saviour tell us that as ſoone as <hi>Lazarus</hi> died, the Angels carried him into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, he came preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the enjoyment of ſome happineſſe in the enjoyment of God. Therefore we are to know here in this place, that God ſpeaketh unto us <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> after the manner of men, God ſpeaking to men, ſpeaketh unto them in the language of men. And as we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily call the carkaſſe of the dead, a dead man: ſo God when he ſaith, <hi>thy dead men ſhall live,</hi> his meaning is not, that there ſhall be a reſurrection of ſpirits, as though the ſoule of man were mortall like the ſoule of a beaſt, and did die with the body, but the meaning is, that the dead bodies of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:180666:200"/>Saints ſhall ariſe. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live.</hi> For the proofe of this I will preſent you with places taken out of the Scripture of truth, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.14. there the Spirit by the Prophet ſpeakes moſt plainly of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I will ranſome them from the power of the grave, I will redeeme them from death; <hi>O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c. which the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. cites, and proves that this Promiſe ſhall be fully accompliſhed to the people of God at the generall reſurrrection.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe God teacheth his holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Ezekiel</hi> this leſſon in a holy viſion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. <hi>The hand of the Lord was upon mee, and carryed me out in the Spirit of the Lord, and ſet me downe in the middeſt of the valley which was full of bones, and cauſed me to paſſe by them round about, and behold there were very many in the open valley, and loe they were very dry. And he ſaid unto me, Son of man can theſe bones live? And I anſwered, O Lord God thou knoweſt. Againe he ſaid unto me, Prophecie upon theſe bones, and ſay unto them, O yee drie bones heare the word of the Lord. Thus ſaith the Lord God unto theſe bones, Behold, I will cauſe breath to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into you, and ye ſhall live. And I will lay ſinewes upon you, and bring up fleſh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:180666:201"/>and ye ſhall live, and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord. Ezek.</hi> 37.1. Here the Prophet doth ſpeak of the reſurrection, and ſhewes that a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life, and power ſhall come upon the drie bones and duſt of the Saints, and that they ſhall live againe in the preſence of God.</p>
               <p>What was <hi>Jobs</hi> Faith and confidence in the middeſt of his ſufferings, but in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection? <hi>Job.</hi> 19.25, 26. <hi>I know that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day upon the Earth; and though after my skin wormes ſhall deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God.</hi> Here is a plaine place, in which the Doctrine of the reſurrection is held forth to us. He profeſſeth that he believed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, and ſpeaking by the Spirit of Chriſt, who is eternall life, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Father made fleſh, he ſaith I ſhall ſee him; with what eyes? with theſe eyes and no other; with theſe very eyes.</p>
               <p>I urged this place to two men, and I had two ſeverall Anſwers from them. One that denyed the reſurrection gave this Anſwer, (I might tremble to ſpeake it) <hi>Job</hi> ſpake as a crazie old man, he knew not what; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this was no ſolid place to prove the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. The ſecond ſaid, he did not ſpeak of the reſurrection; becauſe he ſaith <hi>in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God,</hi> now God is not ſeene with fleſhly eyes.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:180666:201"/>
               <p>But the Anſwer to this is eaſie: he ſpeaks of Chriſt, as God-man: ſo we are ſaid to ſee God when we ſee God in Jeſus Chriſt, as it is <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Behold he commeth with clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo which pierced him: And all kindreds of the earth ſhall waile becauſe of him.</hi> With bodily eyes we may ſee the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his body, and with that ſpirituall eye, and in that ſpirituall body which we ſhal have given unto us at the reſurrection; with that ſpirituall eye, and in that ſpiritual body, we ſhall be able to ſee that ſpirituall body, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath; ſo ſeeing Chriſt, we ſee God: becauſe Chriſt is God <hi>manifeſted in the fleſh</hi> as the Apoſtle calls him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>The places are infinite almoſt in the New-Teſtament, nothing being ſo much preached by the Apoſtles as the Doctrine of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; <hi>Paul</hi> comes to <hi>Athens</hi> among the Epicures and Stoicks, great Schollers, that were fooles and ignorant in Religion, he preacheth the reſurrection, that God would judge the world by the man Chriſt Jeſus: ſo they were to be witneſſes of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to preach Chriſt riſen from the dead; to give evidence and aſſurance to men that they ſhould riſe likewiſe as well as the Lord Jeſus. In the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. there were men crept
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:180666:202"/>into that Congregation, that denyed the reſurrection; therefore what ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doth <hi>Paul</hi> lay downe to prove the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection? He ſhewes that Chriſt dyed in vaine, and that all Religion is in vaine; that the Apoſtles were impoſtors and liers, who preached that Chriſt was riſen, and that the Saints by the power of Chriſt ſhould riſe, if there were no reſurrection. So in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.17. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the ſame ſubject, and ſhewes the manner of the reſurrection, and how Chriſt ſhall come from Heaven, <hi>The Lord himſelfe ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voyce of the Arch-angel, and the Trump of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt,</hi> (<hi>verſe</hi> 16.) Here you ſee he holdeth forth this, that Chriſt who is that mediator between God and man, and true man now in Heaven; this Jeſus Chriſt ſhall deſcend from Heaven, and that the Saints ſhall riſe from the Earth to meet him in the aire. So the Angels told the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. when they looked up to Chriſt, when he aſcended, this ſame Jeſus ſhal ſo come from Heaven, as you now ſee him aſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven: the ſame Chriſt ſhall deſcend from Heaven, and the Apoſtles ſhall ſee him in the ſame manner with the very ſame eves, with which they ſaw him aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:180666:202"/>with the ſame eyes they ſhall ſee him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from Heaven. the Scripture is ſo full, that I need not take more paines to give you more places for the opening of it: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you will pleaſe to take one place more out of the Old Teſtament, (that you may know that they had a cleare knowledge of this in the dayes of the Law, as well as wee have now in the dayes of the Goſpel) <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.12. <hi>And at that time ſhall Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ſtand up, the great Prince which ſtandeth for the Children of thy people,</hi> that is, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who always ſtands for his people <hi>and there ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a Nation, even to the ſame time: and at that time thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be delivered, every one that ſhall be found written in the booke. And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the Earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame, and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting contempt. And they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the firmament, and they that turne many to righteouſnes as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> Here you ſee the ſame thing held forth.</p>
               <p>Though I will not trouble you with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons to confirme this doctrine of the reſurrection: for the truth is, it is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine above Reaſon. I call here, not ſo much
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:180666:203"/>for reaſon, as for Faith, to believe what is above Reaſon, and what ſeemes contrary to carnall reaſon: yet give me leave to give you a reaſon or two drawne from the ſacred truth of Gods word.</p>
               <p>The firſt is drawne from the truth of God, God is true, therefore there will be a reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he ſhould deceive, and delude his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were there not a reſurrection of bodies. Doth he not often tell us of a reſurrection? And doth not our Saviour tell us that hee will raiſe thoſe at the laſt day who are drawn unto him by the Father? (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44.) And therefore unleſſe we will make the great God (which is blaſphemy to think) a lyer; and Chriſt his Sonne a Preacher of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the greateſt impoſtor in the world; and all his Miniſters, Servants, and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, cheaters, juglers, and deceivers of the people, we cannot but acknowledge a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: for God hath ſpoken of it, and hath revealed this to them that there ſhall be ſuch a reſurrection, and they preach it in his name: therefore the God of truth ſhould be found a lyer, if there ſhould not be a reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of bodies according to his word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the juſtice, and mercy of God ſeeme to call for a reſurrection.</p>
               <p>If wee looke upon wicked, and ungodly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:180666:203"/>men, ſo God in Juſtice muſt ſend his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to raiſe the dead, and to judge the world, or elſe how ſhould the juſtice of God ſhine cleare and bright before the eyes, and ſaces of men? This is the Argument that the Apoſtle laies downe, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5, 6. where he ſpeakes of the ſufferings of the Saints, and of the wickedneſſe of their perſecutors, who wrong them for making profeſſion of the truth of the Lord Chriſt; which is (ſaith he) <hi>a manifeſt token of the righteous judgement of God,</hi> it is a demonſtration, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, infallible ſigne, that there will be a judgement day, and a reſurrection; becauſe elſe God ſhould not be juſt, it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you. It is juſt with the God of juſtice to puniſh the veſſells of wrath, diſobedient and wicked men, who never did flee to his grace for life, and ſalvation: it is juſt with him to pay the perſecutors of his people their wages after they have done their worke. Now if there were not a judgement day, if there were not a reſurrection, where ſhould God give them their wages for perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, and troubling them that make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his name? How ſhould God that is the Judge of the world appeare to be juſt? Here is the firſt Argument that God is juſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:180666:204"/>to wicked, and ungodly men; and God could not appeare to be juſt, if there were no judgement day, no reſnrrection, therefore there ſhall be a reſurrection. Now the ſame things fall alike to the juſt and unjuſt; we ſee wicked, and ungodly men thrive, and proſper in the world; they live in pleaſure, there are no bands in their death, as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſpeakes, <hi>they ſpend their dayes in mirth,</hi> and die upon their beds without ſorrow. How ſhould God appeare to be juſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there be another day, when God will call theſe men to a reckning for all the ſinnes, and iniquities which they did commit againſt him when they lived upon the Earth?</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we looke to the mercy of God And this is the Argument that our bleſſed Saviour makes uſe of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.31. When the <hi>Sadduces</hi> came to him, who ſaid there was no reſurrection, nor ſpirit, nor Devill, (as our <hi>Sadduces</hi> doe) who ſay there is no Devill but our owne evill thoughts, nor good Angels, but the good motions of our owne ſpirits, nor any reſurrection of the body. See what Argument he uſeth to prove the reſurrection, as touching the reſurrection, have yee not read that which was ſpoken to you by God ſaying, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob, God is not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:180666:204"/>the God of the dead, but of the living:</hi> God profeſſeth himſelfe the God of dead Saints in a ſpeciall manner; therefore theſe muſt live againe and be made happy by this God, that profeſſeth himſelfe to be their God, while their bodies lye rotting and putrifying in the earth; God in his never failing faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe ownes them in the duſt, keepes their aſhes in ſafety, by which Chriſt doth aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine us that there will be a reſurrection of bodies at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>So that you ſee if this truth be denyed it will overthrow the Scriptures, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us that ſome are veſſels of honour, ſome of diſhonour, that ſome are veſſels of grace, and ſome are veſſels of Gods furie, and indignation; if there be no judgement, day no reſurrection; there cannot be veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wrath, and veſſels of mercy: <hi>If there be no reſurrection, we are of all men moſt miſerable, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. therefore a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection muſt be granted, that Saints may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the veſſels of Gods mercy.</p>

                  <p>That which hath been ſpoken conſutes the blaſphemous and Diabolicall opinion of thoſe that doe oppoſe this Doctrine of the reſurrection. There are two ſorts of theſe,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:180666:205"/>Firſt, ſuch who doe plainly deny the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as <hi>Porphyrius</hi> and others whom we read of. And ſecondly, ſuch who will not ſeeme to deny a reſurrection, but will pretend that they are riſen already, ſpiritually riſen. And they know no other reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe are like thoſe that are mentioned in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. that ſay there is no reſurrection. The latter are like thoſe 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> that ſaid the reſurrection was already paſt. The latter of theſe are the more dangerous. Come, and ask them, is there a reſurrection? Yes, we are riſen, it is paſt, you underſtand the Scripture carnally, and not ſpiritually; you looke on the hiſtory of the word; whereas all the Scripture is myſticall, and allegoricall. Thus theſe in a more plauſible way deny the truth of God, and overthrow the Doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. But theſe places of Scripture, and ſanctified reaſons drawne from the word of truth, ſufficiently confute, and overthrow this damnable curſed opinion of theirs, that ſtrikes at the very roote, and raſeth the foundation of all Religion.</p>
                  <p>This point of the reſurrection is ſo cleerly held forth in Scripture, that thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it, either deny the Scripture to be the word of the Lord Jeſus, or elſe by their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:180666:205"/>and diabolicall interpretation of the word, they pervert the truth of it.</p>
                  <p>Now the latter of theſe are the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: for they ſeeme to carrie a great deale of glory, ſpirituality and truth with them, and make thoſe that are not acquainted with their ſoleciſmes believe that they are very ſpirituall, that they have ſome light, and knowledge, that men have not ordinarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to: Whereas, when you have ſtudied well the depth of their notions, you ſhall find this to be all, if they acknowledge a God: (for I know that there are ſome of theſe that abſolutely deny that there is a God:) that God was from all eternity, and God ſhall indure to all eternitie; and that being that they had in God from all eternitie, that being they ſhall have in God to all eternitie; but the body, and the humane ſpirit ſhall die, and be loſt, and come to nothing.

They conclude (ſaith he) that the Spirit ſhall returne to the eſſence of God, and ſhall be joyned to him, ſo that one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhall onely remaine: as if they ſhould ſay,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:180666:206"/>there is a God that was for ever, and ſhall indure for ever, but all the creatures ſhall come to nothing: when the body dies it ſhall returne to its duſt never to be rayſed, and the ſpirit ſhall vaniſh away, as the ſoft ayre, as thoſe miſcreants in the booke of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> ſpeaks, (<hi>Wiſd.</hi> 2.3.) which if it were a truth there ſhould be no happineſſe for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſpirit of man, or for the body after this life. And I am confident that this is all their new Light affordeth to us and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirituality, or rather infernall ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality (as <hi>Calvin</hi> calleth it, <hi>Infernalem ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualitatem,</hi>) they boaſt of. And this I gather by their owne diſcourſes, and words; and likewiſe by ſearching their writings, and reading their bookes, that have formerly been written, and that lately are brought into the world.</p>
                  <p>But me thinks there is one objection for the preſent comes to my mind, which doth call for an anſwer before I proceede.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If there be ſuch a generation of men as you ſpeak of, that denie the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the reſurrection, and pervert the truth of God, then we may ſee by this what inconvenience would follow, if liberty ſhould be granted to men to practiſe according to their owne judgements, which are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:180666:206"/>to the judgements of the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in the worſhip of God. Therefore it ſeemes there is a neceſſity laid upon Civill powers, that men may be kept from theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and damnable opinions, to make ſtrict Lawes, and impoſe them upon all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And all ſorts of profeſſors to inforce them to come in, and profeſſe Chriſt in their way, or elſe to confiſcate their goods, to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them out of the Countrey, or (if need be) to take away their lives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, this doth not follow, there were ſuch in the time of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, we find him oft diſputing with the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces:</hi> yet we ſee the Lord Jeſus Chriſt did not intend to overthrow the <hi>Sadduces</hi> (that denyed the reſurrection) by ſuch meanes, but dealt with them onely by Scripture, and reaſon, as we ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. And when <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> producing the example of <hi>Elias</hi> deſired Chriſt to command fire to come from Heaven to deſtroy the diſcourteous <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> that refuſed to entertaine them; He denyeth their requeſt with a reproofe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.55. <hi>He rebuked them and ſaid, Yee know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of:</hi> and I thinke it is ſafe for us to imitate the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But in the next place, let me tell you that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:180666:207"/>no Lawes, Statutes, conſtitutions or formes impoſed by men, or Directories, or any thing you can think of, Diſcipline, or Government; can extirpate this out of the hearts of theſe men. For I aſſure you, that few that are of this judgement, will loſe any thing for their Conſcience. Some of them if you bring in Popery, before they will loſe a haire of their head for that which they maintaine, they will be profeſſed Papiſts. We may ſee the picture of theſe men in <hi>Quintinus,</hi> who was the divells Embaſſadour in <hi>Calvins time,</hi> to divulge Familiſticall tenents, of whom he thus ſpeakes, <hi>ſi hodiè Quintinus vinctus tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur, ſive à Chriſtianis, ſive à Papiſtis, &amp; ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur ipſius confeſſioni, non multum eſſet anxius. Certus enim eſſet de ſuâ liberatione quod tum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, tum illorum voluntati aſſentiretur.</hi> If <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> were now impriſoned by Proteſtants, or Papiſts, and ſhould be freed or condemned by his owne confeſſion, it would not much trouble him: for he would be confident of his freedome. Becauſe he would aſſent to the will of either of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calv.</hi> in his <hi>Inſtruc: Adver: Liber: c.</hi> 8. If you threaten them that they ſhall ſuffer any thing, they will preſently tell you that they were overtaken with a fault, and they will be of your mind, if you have any power to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:180666:207"/>puniſh them for what they profeſſe. Like him in the Comedian; <hi>Ais? aio; negas? nego.</hi> Doe you aſſert it? I aſſert it too; doe you denie it? I deny it too.</p>
                  <p>And why ſhould a man be ſo fooliſh as to loſe any thing for that which he profeſſeth in his Conſcience, when he thinkes there ſhall be no reſurrection? He hath no reaſon; he were mad that would part with Earth, and earthly things, that is not ſure of Heaven; he is a mad-man that will lay downe his life, that is not perſwaded there will be a life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death. Therefore I aſſure the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Party if liberty of Conſcience be not granted to Saints, moſt or all theſe will fall in to them: And before Liberty was thought of, there were a great many of theſe in the City, and they conformed to that which was then practiſed, and they will conforme to any Government which ſhall be ſet up by the power of man. It is not any Diſcipline, or Government that can extirpate theſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed opinions out of the hearts of theſe men. And though there be Diſcipline, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtrict Lawes, yet in ſecret wayes they know how to inſinuate poyſon into the hearts and ſpirits of men, to corrupt them from the truth and ſimplicity of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I know ſome of theſe that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:180666:208"/>doe and have preached publickly undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and ſome have now places, and are turned Presbyterians, who profeſſed theſe tenents in the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> that are now gone from the Citie, and have Parochiall Congregations, and are looked on as Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, and Orthodox men, and none ſpeake againſt them, they know how to cover their opinions well enough. This my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of iniquitie is not eaſily diſcovered: ſo that this objection makes nothing againſt Liberty of Conſcience. I thinke it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if it were the Lords will, that theſe men of this wicked, ungodly ſpirit might be knowne, that ſo they may not draw many people into their ſinne, but that the truth of God may be held forth againſt them to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw their errours: for nothing will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw errour but truth. It is not a priſon, it is not the Sword, it is not the power of man that can overthrow errour, and root up falſe opinions out of the hearts of men: it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the power of the truth of the Lord Jeſus. As <hi>Dagon</hi> fell before the Arke, ſo theſe curſed opinions muſt fall before the Arke of truth, by the power of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. For if you threaten them that they ſhall ſuffer any thing, they will preſently tell you that they were overtaken with a fault, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:180666:208"/>they will be of your mind: If you have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to puniſh them for what they profeſſe. But laſtly, this ſhould not be brought as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prejudice thoſe in the enjoyment of their Libertie, who are truly conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For it will have no more force then this. Thieves and rogues ſwarme and abound in the Common-wealth, while Liberty, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and immunities are granted to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, and they are countenanced. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffer not honeſt men to live in the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>Thus having removed an objection which lay in my way, which I perceived might be drawne from the licentiouſneſſe of theſe wicked men, to the wronging of the true Saints and children of the moſt High, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their Liberties, I ſhall now come to anſwer the Objections of theſe adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, they that abſolutely deny the reſurrection, doe thus argue, Doe you think that this body after it is reſolved into its firſt elements, and that part of it is burned in the fire, a part exhaled into the ayre, a part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into water, and a part of it turned into earth, that the ſame numericall body ſhall be raiſed againe? Let a man, one that you call a Saint, be torne in pieces, let the bird
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:180666:209"/>have her prey out of him, let the fiſh have her ſhare, let the devouring beaſt likewiſe have his belly full of his fleſh, let the Caniball come, and have his dinner out of another limbe; and ſhall we believe after all this that this man ſhall riſe againe? What will you bereave us of reaſon? you profeſſe to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall men; how can you ſubſcribe to ſuch a thing, that a man ſhould be burned in the fire, his aſhes caſt into the ſea, And after theſe changes, and tranſmutations, that this man, this ſame man, the ſame body of this man ſhould be raiſed againe? how can any man that hath not put off all reaſon believe it? Thus they contend by their carnall reaſon againſt the truth of the reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>But let me anſwer, though I grant all this which they ſay, that the bodies of the Saints may be reſolved into the firſt Elements, out of which they were made; yet for all this there ſhall be a reſurrection of the very ſame numericall body.</p>
                  <p>For looke to God, he that hath promiſed to doe this, he is omniſcient, he knowes the duſt of his Saints, though it be carryed into the Sea; if a piece of the body of a Saint be in the belly of a fiſh he knowes it there, as well as he knew his ſervant <hi>Jonas</hi> in the belly of the Whale. If it be reſolved to duſt, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:180666:209"/>burned to aſhes; he knowes the duſt of his Saints. We know the Alchymiſt can convert one thing to another, and afterward reduce it to the thing that formerly it was. So ſhall not God (though he ſuffer the bodies of his Saints to undergoe a hundred mutations, and changes, into fire, and water) after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us againe to the ſame bodies in which formerly we were?</p>
                  <p>God knowes where the duſt of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lies as well as the Citizens of <hi>China</hi> know where their earth lies that they lay up for ſome hundreds of yeares, that they may make the purer veſſels of it. God doth but bury us a while in the earth, that at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection he may bring us forth as veſſells of his owne prayſe and glory: and God knowes where he hath hid and laid us. If one limbe be in <hi>Affrica,</hi> another in <hi>Aſia,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Europe,</hi> another in <hi>America,</hi> the Lord knowes how to bring limb to limb, and bone to bone; he is an omniſcient God.</p>
                  <p>And as he is omniſcient, and knows every part of his people, and the duſt of his Saints, and treaſures up the duſt of his Saints, and keeps it in ſafety: So he is a powerfull God, and able to raiſe the bodies of his Saints. As he knowes what duſt and bones belong to a bodie, ſo he is able to bring it againe to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:180666:210"/>the ſame body which it was; and to change it into a more glorious body. He is able to change that ſame numericall mortall body into an immortall body.</p>
                  <p>And though we can find nothing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that can evidently prove this truth: yet we find many ſweet ſigures, ſhadowes and reſemblances of this in nature. Doth not the day die into night, and afterward night riſe againe into the day? doth not Summer die into Autumne, and Autumne into Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then the Spring brings the Summer in glory to us againe? Are not ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which lie dead in Winter, reſtored to life when Summer appeareth? Doe we not ſee the ſeed that is buried in the earth, and put into the furrowes againe to ſpring to a new life, and to come forth with greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then when it was ſowen in the earth:</p>
                  <p>If you take notice of the Gold-Smith you ſhall find that he keeps his fylings, and his duſt, and though we looke on it as a heap worth nothing: yet he knoweth by the Art of the refyner to bring a choyſe and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous veſſell out of that duſt. So though the bodies of the Saints have laine as a heape of duſt, and wee ſee no glory in it; yet God the refyner of Heaven, by the power of his Arme is able to extract the filings and duſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:180666:210"/>of his Saints out of the earth, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore their duſt, to an immortall, ſpirituall, and glorious body; Looke to the power of God, nothing will be impoſſible. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the <hi>Sadduces</hi> cavilled againſt the Doctrine of the reſurrection, our Saviour ſtrikes at the root of their errour, which was this, becauſe they queſtioned the power of God concerning this: <hi>Ye erre,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God,</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 22.) <hi>Qui poteſt facere poteſt reficere, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> he that was able to make the bodie out of nothing, is able to remake it; he that was able to give a being out of no being, is able to give a being out of that that hath a being: It is eaſier to make a thing out of that that hath a being, then out of that that hath no being, God hath done the firſt, why ſhould we diſtruſt him concerning the ſecond?</p>
                  <p>Therefore you ſhall find the Apoſtle when he preached this Doctrine, that we ſhall be raiſed, and in our bodies made like the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and knowing that there would be carnall obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ariſe in the ſpirits of men againſt this Doctrine, he preſently fits and ſhapes an anſwer for it, from the power of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> we looke <hi>for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:180666:211"/>Chriſt who ſhal change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working, whereby he is able to ſubdue even all things to himſelfe.</hi> Here that the mouth of unbeliefe and carnall reaſon may be ſtopped, he tells us that he will make our bodies like unto his glorious bodie: and queſtion not but he will doe it: for he will doe it by his mighty power, by which he is able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things to himſelfe; thus farre in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the firſt ſort of Adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>The objections of the ſpirituall Enemies, or rather diabolicall Enemies (though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſpirituality) are drawn from Scripture. And this is no wonder, for their Father the Devill doth quote Scripture ſometimes too. The firſt place which they alleadge, is in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. <hi>Fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption:</hi> from whence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that our corruptible and fleſhly body ſhal not be raiſed: And therefore that there is no ſuch reſurrection to be expected which we waite for; But that the Apoſtle in this Chapter and all other places ſpeaking of the reſurrection, doth treat of it ſpiritually &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorically; And that he never did hold forth ſuch a carnall and groſſe reſurrection, as we in our muddie braines doe groſſely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend he did.</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:180666:211"/>
                  <p>In anſwer to which objection, we ſhall grant that the Apoſtle in ſundry places, doth ſpeake of a reſurrection figuratively. As in the 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeelie thoſe things which are above,</hi> where he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of a reſurrection to a new life in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by faith. And in this ſenſe we grant that Saints are already riſen. There being no happineſſe for ſuch at the ſecond reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereafter, who are not firſt raiſed here, and made partakers of the firſt reſurrection. Yet this doth not weaken our aſſertion, nor overthrow our Faith. And therefore give me leave to put in an anſwer to their obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is true, <hi>fleſh and blood ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdome of God.</hi> What doth he meane? he meanes, ſinfull fleſh, and bloud ſhall not inherit; whatſoever is ſinne, and fleſh, in this reſpect, ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, fleſh and blood may be taken for the weakneſſes, and infirmities that cleave to our bodies for the preſent, and fleſh and blood, our bodies of fleſh and blood if wee looke on them in their frailties, infirmities, and weakneſſes, ſo they ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God. But otherwiſe it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, theſe bodies which are fleſh and blood,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:180666:212"/>ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God. For as our Lord Chriſt is now in glory, in the ſame body, though it be a ſpirituall glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Heaven, in which he ſuffered on the Croſſe, ſo we who believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be raiſed, goe to Heaven, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God in happineſſe in theſe very bodies that we carrie about us, we ſhall ſee God with theſe eyes and no other, we ſhall have the ſame feet, hands and members, &amp;c. And though there ſhall be no ſinne, frailty, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or infirmitie, no imperfection, lameneſſe, deafneſſe, or blindneſſe, yet the ſame nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall body ſhall be raiſed againe. And if God would but open their eyes to read and underſtand what is ſpoken, they ſhall have an anſwer from the pen of him whom they through their blindneſſe doe miſunderſtand in the 53. <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſame chapter, <hi>This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall muſt put on immortality.</hi> The ſame mortall body, by him who is immortall muſt be made immortall and incorruptible.</p>
                  <p>This was the confeſſion of the <hi>African</hi> Churches, <hi>Credimus reſurrectionem carnis hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus:</hi> we believe the reſurrection of this fleſh: which is conſonant to the truth delivered by <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We muſt all appeare before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:180666:212"/>receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> The ſame perſons muſt appeare, we that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of a materiall body and ſpirituall ſoule, muſt appeare in the ſame body and ſoule, or elſe it is not we that ſhall appeare but ſome body elſe which ſhall appeare, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the mind of God, and his Apoſtle in this place. The ſecond objection which they bring is this, that we that profeſſe Chriſt and a reſurrection by him, in this way are carnall, and know Chriſt after the fleſh, whereas the Apoſtle ſaith in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. That he is to be knowne ſo no more. To which I anſwer, that this is one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, one of the things hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in <hi>Paul</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. which they being unſtable, wreſt as they doe other Scriptures, unto their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Paul</hi> hath no ſuch meaning, which they carnally draw from the letter of the word, which will appeare, if we conſider the Chriſt which he preached, who <hi>was made of the ſeed of David according to the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 1.3. <hi>crucified</hi> in the fleſh for our ſinnes, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. riſen from the dead for our <hi>Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Rom.</hi> 4.25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20. aſcended in our humane nature in which he ſuffered and deſcended into the lower parts of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:180666:213"/>earth, 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> and in that humane nature doth make Interceſſion for us at his Fathers right hand, as our Mediatour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. If he meanes that which they draw from his words, he knew Chriſt after the fleſh in all his Sermons, and his Faith was a knowledge of Chriſt after the fleſh. And therefore that which they wreſt from his words is not his meaning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning is this, that Chriſt is not to be knowne after the fleſh. As though any men ſhould conceive that they ſhould have any priviledge or prerogative above another in Chriſt, becauſe they are his kinſmen or Countrey-men according to the fleſh, or of the ſame ſtock with Chriſt, being deſcended from <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>David</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh. Thus Chriſt is not to be knowne after the fleſh. It will availe men nothing that they are neere to Chriſt in the fleſh by their naturall birth, unleſſe they be neare to Chriſt, and one with Chriſt by their new birth: So that the Apoſtle doth in this place take away the difference which ſome might apprehend, to be between the <hi>Jew</hi> and the <hi>Gentile.</hi> It is parallel to that place <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for yee are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:180666:213"/>And this is evident by the precedent <hi>verſe,</hi> where he ſaith that Chriſt died for all, for <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as for <hi>Jewes,</hi> ſo that a <hi>Jew</hi> may as ſoone be ſaved by Chriſt as a <hi>Gentile,</hi> if he reſt upon the grace of the Father through the redemption which is in Chriſt Jeſus his Sonne for Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It will likewiſe appeare to be the plain and naked meaning of the Apoſtle, if we conſider the ſubſequent words, where he doth publiſh forth the ſame thing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth his meaning, telling us that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them. The ſinfull <hi>Gentiles</hi> who are called the world in oppoſition to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that were Gods peculiar and ſelected people, gathered out of the world from other Nations. God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to this world, to ſinfull <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as to Gods owne people the <hi>Jewes.</hi> And therefore Chriſt is not to be knowne among Chriſtians in any carnall or fleſhly relations, as though he were a Saviour more to the <hi>Jewes</hi> then to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This were to know Chriſt after the fleſh, but we that know him ſpiritually know him ſo no more, for in the Spirit we ſee the partition wall which was between <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> pulled down; and know Chriſt the common Saviour both
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:180666:214"/>to <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which ſhall believe in his name. And thus I have given you an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer fully ſatisfactory to their ſecond obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>The third place from which they frame an objection, is in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That which befalleth unto the Sonnes of men, befalleth beaſts, even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, ſo dieth the other, yea they have all one breath, ſo that a man hath no preheminence above a beaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I thus anſwer, that <hi>Solomon</hi> here doth not propoſe this as his owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but rather doth repreſent unto us the opinion of carnall men, who have no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light then the dimme eye of reaſon.

For as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are to imbrace the truth of God with all zeale and affection of ſpirit: ſo we are to deteſt and abhor all errours that oppoſe the truth of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with all zeale, and fervency of ſpirit: though theſe are much offended with the zeale and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Saints: ſuppoſing that ſuch heat and holy anger is inconſiſtent with the ſpirit of meekneſſe, and therefore, if a man (though in the Spirit) witneſſe againſt theſe conceits, and atheiſticall opinions of theirs, preſently they ſay, that though he pretend to be the ſervant of Chriſt, and to have the Spirit of Chriſt; yet he hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, becauſe he is ſo ſharp in his ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>But conſider, how our bleſſed Saviour oft in his preaching, and diſcourſes thunders, and lightens in the faces of men that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the truth. Did he not call the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> a Generation of Vipers, and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers to their faces? and hath not <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſions to this purpoſe? <hi>Peter</hi> tells <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> he was in the very gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe?

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:180666:215"/>your father the Devill.</hi> Therefore know, that as Chriſt, (though he had the holy Spirit in him, yet) he made uſe of ſuch ſharp and bitter ſpeeches, ſo a man may have ſuch ſpeeches in his mouth, and yet he may be in the ſpirit of God, and ſpeak to Gods glory when he thus ſpeaks. The Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is commended, that he could not beare with thoſe that were evill. And that he hated the workes of the <hi>Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> himſelfe, and our Saviour doth profeſſe his hatred to the Doctrine of the <hi>Nicolaitans.</hi> And why ſhould a Chriſtian be afraid to imitate his Saviour, though theſe will cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him for it? If this be to be vile and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out love, to ſpeak bitterly againſt ſuch bitter enemies of Chriſt, ſhould not a zealous Chriſtian ſay as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Michal</hi> when ſhe ſcoffed him for his devotion to his God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.22. <hi>I will be yet more vile then thus?</hi> Therefore let me deſire you, that you will abhorre theſe tenents and opinions of theirs, which doe overthrow the whole Doctrine of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. If this that they hold be a truth, which we denie; there is no truth in this booke that we hold; if this be a truth that they profeſſe, there is no truth in Jeſus Chriſt that profeſſeth himſelfe the way, the truth and the life.

The heavenly company of Martyrs that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed their lives for Chriſt, doe deſerve rather to be regiſtred in the Catalogue of fooles, then to be dignified, or innobled as Saints with the Crowne of Martyrdome, had they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and queſtioned the truth of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. This hath made their ſufferings comfortable to them, and glorious to us as our patterne and example for imitation. This hath made them ſo willing to hazard their lives for the truth of Chriſt. It is this that hath made them ſo prodigall of their blood; that I remember it is reported of one of the heathen perſecutors, that he ſaid he thought the Chriſtians delighted in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they ſeemed to ſleight all puniſhments and tortures, that the witty malice of their adverſaries could invent, or their cruelty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. This carried them forth in that height of ſpirit, that they rejoyced in the middeſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:180666:218"/>of tortures. It was this that cheered the heart of a Martyr, that was troubled a little before his ſuffering, the Comforter coming and aſſuring him of happineſſe at the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Gregorius Nazianzenus</hi> in his third Oration tells us of <hi>Theclas</hi> and ſome other Martyrs that were obſerved by the ſpectators (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This is that that the Apoſtle proves to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. <hi>Some were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtaine a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> He informeth us that when delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was offered, they would not accept of it. What was the reaſon? they expected a reſurrection; Threatnings could not terrifie them from the truth, nor promiſes draw them to errour, becauſe they were without wavering perſwaded of a reſurrection. This
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:180666:219"/>was that that made <hi>Polycarpus</hi> the Martyr ſo willing todie for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which appeareth by his ſpeech when he was tied at the ſtake, I thanke thee that thou haſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly vouchſafed this day, to allot me a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the number of Martyrs, among the people of Chriſt unto the reſurrection of the everlaſting life, both of body and ſoule, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p>For I would have you to take notice that God ſeldome ſuffers men that are growne to this height of unbeliefe, and ungodlineſſe, to deny the reſurrection, and Chriſts coming in the fleſh, to die without galled and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conſciences.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:180666:220"/>when they came to lie on their death-beds, none ſeemed to be more afraid of a God, and to tremble ſo much at his power as theſe men: ſo none are more afraid of death, Hell, and a reſurrection, then ſome of theſe that have denyed that there is any Hell or a reſurrection. I remember the ſpeech of <hi>Zeno</hi> the Philoſopher, if I would perſwade any man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Atheiſme, ſaid he, I would lead him to the death-bed of an Atheiſt when he is gaſping out his laſt breath.

I ſhall not need at the preſent to adde many more words, for I hope better things of you, and ſuch things which accompanie ſalvation, I hope there are few ſuch ſpirits as theſe, in this Congregation, yet I know the Devill is ſo ſubtle, that where he thinks people are moſt ſpirituall, and know God moſt, and are acquainted with Chriſt, he ſends his imps, his <hi>Sadduces</hi> to trouble, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:180666:220"/>aſſault them: he doth not ſet ſo much upon any people to draw them away, as upon thoſe that make profeſſion of the Goſpel of Chriſt. The Devill knowes ſuch whom he hath ſafe within his owne command, and many of theſe are not aſſaulted by theſe imps, but when men ſeeme to be heirs, and boaſt of the Lord Jeſus, and profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in the ſpirit of glory and adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to have their names written in Heaven, and that none are able to ſeparate them from the love of God; the Devill ſends his evill Angells to ſuch men as theſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing that you ſhould meet with ſuch ſpirits, I thought good to ſpeake ſomewhat before that being forewarned you might be fore-armed, <hi>(praemoniti praemuniti)</hi> that you may goe on in the power of God, and the ſtrength of his might: though the Devill may buffet you for a time by theſe wicked inſtruments, and caſt his fiery darts into your hearts, and ſpirits to perſwade you that there is no reſurrection, and may certainly know that if there be any truth in the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpel, this is a truth, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reſurrection. And it is the deſire of my ſoule that ye may live continually and conſtantly in the confidence and aſſurance of the reſurrection of your bodies, which being
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:180666:221"/>joyned with a lively Faith in Chriſts death and reſurrection, will ſweeten your lives and crowne your deaths with happineſſe. Death which came in upon men as a legall curſe, ſhall be turned into a bleſſing unto you, it ſhall not be your feare, but deſire, with <hi>Paul</hi> ye ſhall deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt. But this Doctrine being layd aſide as of no worth, or value, Chriſt will appeare unto you but a ſhadow, fancy, and forged Chymera of mans braine: As the wicked Pope was perſwaded, who did thus glory in his riches, What great riches have we got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by this fable of Chriſt! Wherefore as you deſire to breath forth your ſoules with joy into the boſome of the Lord Jeſus, live in the comforts of the reſurrection through Chriſt. That will make you ſay in the midſt of the pangs of death with <hi>Simeon, Lord let thy ſervant now depart, for mine eyes have ſeene thy ſalvation.</hi> Or elſe ſuch muſick will bee in your hearts, as was in <hi>Stephens</hi> when he prayed, Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit; yee ſhall have peace at the laſt, which ſhall bee everlaſting.

If it doe not clearely appeare from this place, yet it doth from others: for it is ſaid, he was made of the <hi>ſeed of David according to the fleſh.</hi> And likewiſe <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>The word was made fleſh.</hi> And, <hi>great is the myſtery of godlineſſe, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. which will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow that which ſome Familiſticall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits dare to aſſert in our times, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt never had any naturall bodie, allegorizing the whole hiſtory of the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, life and death, reſurrection and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, if it be thus expounded as ſome learned men doe expound the words, the next obſervation will be this, that</p>
               <p>This bodie of Chriſt was a dead body. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.18. <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead.</hi> The true Chriſt in his body was once dead;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:180666:222"/>his body was a crucified body; <hi>He his own ſelf</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>in his owne body bare our ſinnes upon the Croſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>He was wounded for our iniquities, his body was bruiſed for our tranſgreſſions, Iſa.</hi> 53. Thirdly, that</p>
               <p>The dead body of the Lord Jeſus was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>with my dead body they ſhall riſe,</hi> it is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that this dead body ſpoken of ſhall ariſe, and this is that, that is ſo frequently preached by the Apoſtles, who were witneſſes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, to teſtifie that the Lord Jeſus did riſe from the dead.</p>
               <p>The Devill knew what a truth this was, how much life, glory, ſweetneſſe, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er there is in it; therefore he imployed his inſtruments the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> to doe what they could to ſmother this truth of the reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus: What lies did they not make? what ſtones did they, not turne? what paines did they not take that they might poſſeſſe the people with this perſwaſion, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt did never riſe out of the grave: but that his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples came and ſtole him away?</p>
               <p>But (brethren) Chriſt is riſen, and thoſe that rightly underſtand this, doe find what ſweetneſſe, and conſolation comes to their hearts, by believing this point. There is ſo much in it, that <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth, he deſired
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:180666:223"/>to know nothing but Chriſt, and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. the power of his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings. And <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. ſaith, that God <hi>hath begotten us againe to a lively hope through the reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The hope of the Diſciples was almoſt dead, and extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, when the Lord Jeſus lay in the grave; but now Chriſt is riſen, and hath diſcovered his power in vanquiſhing his, and all our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, now we have a lively hope in us that believe the reſurrection of Chriſt: for in the believing of his reſurrection we have a ſweet, and comfortable aſſurance of our owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>with my dead body ſhall they riſe</hi> Chriſt (as I hinted before) did all things, and ſuffered all things as a publick perſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And he that believes this in the ſpirit, ſees that he himſelfe is riſen with the Lord. There is is a two-fold reſurrection.</p>
               <p>A reſurrection by Faith, when we doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:180666:223"/>that we are riſen in Chriſt, our King, head, and leader; and there is a reſurrection in our owne perſons, when we ſhall be raiſed in our owne bodies. Chriſt did riſe for the good, and in the behalfe of all his people, and Chriſt keepes poſſeſſion of Heaven after his reſurrection for us, in whoſe perſon we are already riſen, and in this reſpect it may be ſaid, <hi>that together with his dead body we ſhall ariſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>with my dead body ſhall they riſe.</hi> Some interpret it thus: by the power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt they ſhall riſe, that is, there ſhall come at the laſt day, a power from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to raiſe up the Saints to enjoy glory with the Father. But becauſe I doe not find theſe two words in the Hebrew, <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> nor <hi>with:</hi> therefore be pleaſed to let me paſſe by, theſe obſervations, and to give you what I doe apprehend to be the plaine meaning of the text; and to read the words thus.
<q>My dead body ſhall they riſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They are the words of the Lord Jeſus, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by him for the comfort of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, aſſuring them that they ſhall be raiſed as his body. And though ſome doe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them concerning the reſtauration of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and the bringing in of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:180666:224"/>Chriſt: yet I apprehend that this is the true, ſpirituall meaning of God in the words which I have opened to you this day. The point then will be this, the dead bodies of the Saints which ſhall be raiſed, are the dead bodies of Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>cadaver meum reſurgent,</hi> They ſhall ariſe as my carkaſſe or dead body: which I ſhall enlarge by ſome conſiderations. Firſt conſideration, Chriſt and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are one: therefore the Saints ſhall be raiſed as the body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The members of the body, are the members of the head: Chriſt Jeſus he is the head of the body; therefore the bodies of the Saints being raiſed, they are raiſed as the body of the Lord Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30. <hi>We are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones.</hi> The body of a Saint is the body of the Lord Jeſus, the fleſh of a Saint is the fleſh of the Lord Jeſus; and the ſpirit of a Saint is one with the ſpirit of Jeſus. <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuted the Saints, and caſt their bodies into priſon; Chriſt calls to him from heaven, <hi>Why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt thou me?</hi> When the body of a Saint is impriſoned, Chriſt is then ſhut up in priſon; ſo when the bodies of the Saints are raiſed, the body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is raiſed: As the Animall ſpirits lie in the head, by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:180666:224"/>which, motion is conveyed to the members: ſo the ſpirit of power lies in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by which we are moved, by which we are raiſed; in which ſpirit we both in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſpirit are made one with the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine of our union with Chriſt is likewiſe ſet forth by <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Know you not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are the members of Chriſt? ſhall I then take the members of Chriſt, and make them the members of a harlot?</hi> As the hand or foot of a man, may be ſaid to be part of the man, ſo the bodies of the Saints may be ſaid to be part of the Lord Jeſus. For as the head and all the members of the body make one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body in that one ſpirit that is in them all, and acts in them all; ſo Chriſt and all believers make one in fleſh and ſpirit, by that one ſpirit which dwells in the fleſh of Chriſt; and in the fleſh, and ſpirit of every true believer. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body: ſo alſo is Chriſt:</hi> Here you ſee that the Apoſtle calls the members of Chriſt, Chriſt myſticall, ſo alſo is Chriſt ſaith he, he gives the Church the name of Chriſt, by reaſon of this neare uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is between Chriſt Jeſus, and all his members.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:180666:225"/>
               <p>Againe, the Saints they are married to the Lord Jeſus, &amp; as the body of the wiſe may be ſaid to be the husbands: ſo the bodies of the Saints as wel as their ſouls belong to the Lord Jeſus, and are one with him. And as <hi>Adam,</hi> when <hi>Eve</hi> was brought to him, ſaid, <hi>This is bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh:</hi> ſo Chriſt when the dead bodies of the Saints ſhall be raiſed, raiſes his owne body, and will ſay, <hi>This is bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh,</hi> then ſhall be the great marriage of the Lamb; then it ſhall be ſolemnized in a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner; and then Chriſt ſhall owne all thoſe who were given to him by the Father; and there in a ſolemne manner ſhall he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie them to himſelfe, he ſhall owne them all for his own wife, and they all ſhall be looked on as one in him. Likewiſe, the bodies of the Saints that are raiſed, are the body of Chriſt, as the ſprigs of a tree, or the branches of a vine, may be ſaid to be part of the tree, or part of the vine. Our Saviour ſets forth this ſimilie to us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. where he compares himſelf to a vine, and all believers to branches in this vine: Chriſt ſhall be as the great vine in the reſurrection, and all believers ſhall be branches, and ſprigs ſprouting out of this vine from that life, power, and ſpirit that God ſhall put forth through the body of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:180666:225"/>Lord Jeſus. This union is not by the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of things which are united, as the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Familiſts doe fondly conceive, but by the union of things which are different in their perſonall beings, and individuall natures, which will appeare by the ſimilitudes, which God doth make uſe of for the illuſtrating of this truth unto us. As of body and members: though all the members doe make but one body, yet every member doth retaine its proper place, office and being in the body; ſo that the hand is not the foot, nor the foot the arme, or head: ſo it is between Chriſt and his people, Chriſt ſtill remaineth in his owne perſon as head, and they as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall members belonging to that head. The ſpirit and body make one man, yet the ſpirit is not the body, nor the body the ſpirit. The vine and branches are one, yet the vine is not the branch, nor the branch the vine: The Husband and wife are one, yet the Husband is not the wife, nor the wife the Husband. The ſecond conſideration for the amplifying of this point may be this, becauſe that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he did or ſuffered, was that he might bring all believers to an oneneſſe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the Father, and this is that he prayes for, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>The glory that thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:180666:226"/>we are one:</hi> Chriſt did therefore beare our ſinnes, Chriſt did therefore put himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the curſes due to us for our enormities; he did therefore manifeſt himſelfe as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour over all the Enemies that oppoſed us, that all things that might bee any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to our union, or hinder our ſpirituall communion with God, being removed in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 12.14. we might be brought to an oneneſſe, and ſee our ſelves as one body, and one ſpirit with him. Our happineſſe lyeth in our oneneſſe with Father, Word and Spirit, which are but one. Man made himſelfe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable by diſuniting himſelfe from God, who is but one, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.29. and Chriſt doth make him happy by bringing him back again to that oneneſſe which he had with God. It was the office and employment of Chriſt, to bring all things from diſunion, to union and oneneſſe with himſelfe, and the Father, which he hath effected for us, and therefore they ſhall be raiſed, as the body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>My dead body ſhall they riſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third conſideration is this, they ſhall riſe as his dead body, becauſe they ſhall riſe as the proper goods, poſſeſſion, and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:180666:226"/>the utmost parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion;</hi> they ſhall be raiſed as the body of Chriſt; becauſe Chriſt ſhall have a right, propriety, and Intereſt in them. <hi>Ye are not your owne, yee are bought with a price,</hi> your bodies as well as your ſpirits are Gods, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. the Apoſtle gives this reaſon, why <hi>Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and revived, and roſe againe, that he might be Lord, of the quick and dead, Rom.</hi> 14.9. that as a ſervant is more his Maſters then his owne: ſo Chriſt being the Lord of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, we ſhall be more his then our owne: we ſhall be raiſed as thoſe in whom Chriſt hath a propriety, and Intereſt: we ſhall be looked on as the inheritance of the Lord Jeſus, he ſhall be King and Lord over us all, and rule over us: His Scepter of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be ſet up in every heart; and his Throne ſhall be exalted in every ſpirit. Thus; <hi>My dead body they ſhall riſe.</hi> They ſhall riſe as mine: they are my dead men, and they ſhall be my living men. Here you ſee that Chriſt will owne them for his when they are in the duſt. There are ſome that ſhall ſpeak to Chriſt at the reſurrection, as though they were familiarly acquainted with him, whom he will not owne, ſaving, <hi>Depart from me I know you not yee workers of iniquitie.</hi> But Chriſt will owne his Saints, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:180666:227"/>
                  <hi>They ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, when I make up my Jewells or ſpeciall treaſure, and I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his owne ſonne that ſerveth him.</hi> As men will not part with their Jewells, ſo Chriſt will not loſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of his Saints, they are part of his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all treaſure.</p>
               <p>The fourth conſideration is this; the bodies of the Saints that ſhall be raiſed may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the body of the Lord Jeſus, for this reaſon: becauſe Chriſt in the Spirit ſhall be the life, ſoule, and forme that ſhall give life and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bodies of the Saints at the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. As the body is called, the body of the Spirit that dwells in it, ſo Chriſt Jeſus dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the bodies of his Saints by his Spirit, their bodies may be ſaid to be his body. And as a man may ſay, this is my body, it belongs to that humane ſpirit in me: becauſe his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſpirit moves, lives in it, and doth as a Divine power act in it: ſo our bodies being raiſed, may be ſaid to be the bodies of Chriſt, becauſe he ſhall act as the Spirit, forme, and ſoule in them. Chriſt ſhall be the ſoule which ſhall give life and being to all Saints which ſhall be raiſed by him.</p>
               <p>The fifth conſideration. Death cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the union which is between Chriſt and a believer. The love of the Father is the urnein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:180666:227"/>which the aſhes of dead Saints are preſerved <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. <hi>I am perſwaded,</hi> ſaith Paul <hi>that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come; nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> Man doth conſiſt of a naturall body and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſpirit. And death cannot make a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between Gods love and our bodies, no more then it can make a ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his love and our ſoules. Among the things which God hath beſtowed upon us in Chriſt, the Apoſtle doth reckon up death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. which ſheweth that it is not a curſe, but a bleſſing to Saints. It would be a curſe unto us, did it bring an irrecoverable ruine and deſtruction to our bodies. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord.</hi> Deaths diſability to caſt our bodies out of Gods love and protection is that which doth convert death through Chriſt into a bleſſing unto us. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth Saints in reſpect of their bodily death, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.14. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Thoſe that ſleep in Chriſt. As leep doth not bereave men of life, ſo death doth not take away from Saints their life which is in Chriſt. As a Philoſopher told a tyrant he might kill him but not hurt him;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:180666:228"/>ſo death may kill but cannot hurt a Saint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the union between God and him is in diſſolvible, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Whether we live or di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>My dead body ſhall they ariſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sixt conſideration. The bodies of Saint are ſanctified by Chriſt, and therefore he cannot but owne them. Sanctification is the marke or ſeale of Chriſt. As merchants do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:180666:228"/>And therefore all the bodies of the Saints muſt be raiſed as his body.

               <p>And thus having opened this Doctrine, and illuſtrated it by theſe conſiderations, I ſhall draw ſome uſefull concluſions from it.</p>

                  <p>There being ſuch a glorious union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and Chriſt, it ſhould engage the ſpirits of Saints to be much in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of it. As the bloud and ſpirits doe runne through the body, ſo this Doctrine of union doth runne through the whole body of Chriſtian Religion. Our Juſtification in the perſon of Chriſt, &amp; our own Juſtification in our owne perſons by Chriſt cannot bee clearely underſtood, if we be totally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of union with Chriſt. As the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſaith, that all morall vertues are linck'd together in juſtice, ſo all the points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity are concatenated and joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this doctrine of union.</p>
                  <p>As the Starre did lead the wiſe men to Chriſt, ſhining over the place where Chriſt was, ſo this Doctrine of our union with Chriſt, ſhining among other truths of Chriſt in the Scripture, doth hold forth unto us a light to direct us through the grace of God,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:180666:230"/>into a perfect, and comfortable knowledge of all other truths. As it doth in an eſpeciall manner beame forth light unto us, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme us in the Doctrine of the reſurrection. For you ſee that the bodies of the Saints are to bee raiſed, becauſe they are united to Chriſt, and one with him. Therefore this may ſtrengthen the Faith of every one of us concerning the certainty of the reſurrection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> What ſaith the Apoſtle? <hi>No man yet ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his owne fleſh, but nouriſhed it, and cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it, Eph.</hi> 5.29. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt cannot hate his owne fleſh, nor forget his owne body, the bodies of the Saints, but in love will raiſe them; even while they lie in the duſt they are his body. Our propriety in a thing doth draw out our affection to the thing. Our bodies belong to the Lord, and are in his heart and affections, even while they moulder in the duſt; therefore let this truth pierce your underſtandings, and ſinke deepe into your memories, and be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that your bodies ſhall be raiſed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not ſo much your bodies as the body of the Lord Jeſus. The Scripture, as you have heard, ſpeakes ſo gloriouſly of that union, which all the Saints have with Jeſus Chriſt in that one Spirit which is in Chriſt, and in every Saint, that it ſeemes to hold
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:180666:230"/>forth Chriſt as incompleat, till he have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all his members into one body. And certainly, Chriſt will not appeare incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in his body at the reſurrection, which he ſhould doe, ſhould hee not by his power command the bodies of the Saints to come out of the earth. Therefore he will not ſuffer any part of himſelfe to lie in the duſt, he will not appeare at the generall reſurrection, without a limb, not without a hand; not without a finger; not without the leaſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Thou that art the meaneſt Chriſtian, that apprehendeſt thy ſelfe to be but as the toe of Chriſt, mayſt be ſtrongly perſwaded of thy reſurrection, for I tell thee when Chriſt ſhall appeare at the great reſurrection, he will not be without a toe; not without the loweſt, and moſt inferiour member of his body. He will appeare in his fulneſſe, and all the Saints gathered together and made one with him in body and ſpirit, are his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and compleatneſſe. The King when he rides in triumph, or to his great Counſell, he rides in his Royall Robes and in all his glory. When Chriſt ſhall appeare the ſecond time, he will ride in Triumph as a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of all Enemies, and will ride to his great Counſell or Parliament of Saints, who are to judge the Delinquents of the world.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:180666:231"/>And the Saints are his glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. and therefore they muſt be raiſed that hee may be in his full glory.</p>
                  <p>If thou looke upon thy ſelfe, and thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and conſider how thou haſt diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God in thy body; (it may bee) thou mayſt be ſtartled in thy ſpirit; and have ſuch ſad thoughts as theſe; Will Chriſt ever raiſe this body as his, that I have abuſed to ſinne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhall this body be glorified which I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by baſe and filthy luſts? but when thou haſt any ſuch thoughts as theſe, in which the Devill appeares to thee as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, to make thee queſtion the truth of the glorious reſurrection of thy body then looke beyond thy ſelfe, beyond the ſinnes that thou haſt committed againſt God in thy body, and ſpirit. And think thus with thy ſelfe; This body, though I have abuſed it by luſt and intemperance: though I have diſhonoured God by the ſinnes which I have committed, and acted as it were upon a ſtage in this body, and fleſh of mine; yet now the property is altered; I am not now to looke on it as my body, I am to look on it as the body of the Lord Jeſus: it is that body, that he hath waſhed from all ſinne in his owne bloud; it is that body, that he died for, that he might cleanſe it from fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:180666:231"/>and uncleanneſſe; it is his body, he hath right to it, and a propriety in it: it is his, and none of mine. Chriſt will not loſe that which belongs to himſelfe and therefore it ſhall be raiſed in glory. We ſee how unwilling men are to part with that which is their poſſeſſion, and inheritance. We know how <hi>Naboth</hi> anſwered <hi>Ahab,</hi> who would have had his Vineyard, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.3. <hi>Should I give the inheritance of my Fathers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee?</hi> we are the inheritance, the poſſeſſion of the Lord Jeſus; and he will not loſe any part of his inheritance. This Argument is of ſufficient ſtrength to ſilence carnall reaſon, if it were throughly weighed by us in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary. For if a man look on himſelfe as out, of himſelfe, and the being which he hath in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and behold himſelfe as one with the Lord Jeſus, in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall oneneſſe, ſeeing himſelfe as ſuch a part of Chriſt, as a hand, or a foote may be ſaid to be a part of the bodie; and knowing Chriſt hath undertaken to provide for his body, and to owne it for his owne: this will eſtabliſh him in an unſhaken confidence, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt intends to raiſe his body, and to aſſure and aſcertaine us that he will raiſe us, he himſelfe is riſen in his own perſon: If the head be above the water, the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:180666:232"/>whole body may be drawne out of the water without drowning; Chriſt our head is above water, above the billowes that overwhelmed him; is above ſinne that was charged on him; is above the curſes of the Law that came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, when he was made a ſacrifice for ſinne; above the temptations of Satan; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the weakneſſe of the fleſh. Death could not hold him as her priſoner: and this may aſcertaine us, that wee his members ſhall be drawne up out of the water; wee ſhall be above all things that we may call ſinne in our ſelves, above the reach of Satans fiery darts, we ſhall be above Death: that will be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled which is ſpoken in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in victory:</hi> Chriſt hath already fully conquered Death in his owne perſon, and will conquer it, in the perſon of all thoſe that are his members, enabling them to believe in him.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt doth infuſe ſpirit, and fortitude into all his ſouldiers by enabling them to looke on him their Generall. <hi>Reſpice ad Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,</hi> Look unto your Captaine, was the old Roman word of Command, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſouldiers, to ſtirre them up to imitate the valour and fortitude of their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And Chriſtian ſouldiers are made truly valiant, by looking upon the fortitude and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:180666:232"/>conqueſts of him who is the Captaine of their ſalvation. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. And knowing their union with him, they ſee their head &amp; Captaine riſen, whoſe they are, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them Conquerours of death, as his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant ſouldiers by a ſtrong perſwaſion from him, and in him of a future reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>In the next place you ſee, that the bodies of Saints ſhal be raiſed for heaven as his body. Therefore this may teach us to glorifie God in our bodies and ſpirits while wee are here below: If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will raiſe our bodies as his owne bodie: it is conſonant to reaſon, that we ſhould uſe our bodies as the bodies of Chriſt. This conſideration (if God goe along with it) will be marvellous powerfull to teach us to be holy, not only in our ſpirits, but in our bodies, conſidering that they are the bodies of the Lord Jeſus. Chriſt will raiſe thy body at the laſt day as his owne, it is his body, and not thine: his ſpirit informes it, he is owner, and poſſeſſor of it, <hi>thou art not thine owne, thou art bought with a price,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Thererefore glorifie God in thy body and in thy Spirit, which are Gods.</hi> Seeing Chriſt will raiſe thy body as his body, when it is dead, therefore behave thy ſelfe towards thy body, as the body of Chriſt while thou art alive.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:180666:233"/>
                  <p>This is that that the Apoſtle preſſeth from this conſideration, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Shall I take the members of Chriſt, and make them the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a harlot?</hi> a Chriſtian would not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeane himſelfe toward his body, if he did conſider what his body is, it is the houſe and Palace of the Lord Jeſus, the Temple of God. It was accounted a great fault for any man to miſbehave himſelfe in the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which was a place then, by Gods appointment more holy then other places. Our bodies are ſpirituall Temples: therefore defile not the Temple of the Lord. Bring not in, the abomination of deſolation into the holy place: bring not the filth of ſinne into it: ſuffer not luſt to lie in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: ſuffer not pride in thy fleſh: ſinne not againſt thy owne body in any kind: take heed of riot, and drunkenneſſe; take heed of thoſe ſins that are ſinnes againſt the body: becauſe by them thou ſinneſt againſt the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and houſe of God, thou ſinneſt againſt that, that is not thine owne, but is the Lord Jeſus Chriſts.</p>
                  <p>Our bodies ſhould not be like the Egyptian Temples, that were ſtately Edifices and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, but in them there was nothing, but ſome noyſome, and filthy beaſts. Thy body is a ſtately Edifice: O ſet not up thy beaſtly

Thou muſt not only looke on thy body as it is a naturall Edifice: but as it is a building for the Lord Jeſus, as a Temple that Chriſt hath made choyſe of; a Temple for the Holy Spirit to dwell in. Therefore ſuffer not Crocodiles, and noyſome beaſts to ſit there: ſtoup not to luſts: fall not downe on thy knees before thy corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſacrifice not to uncleanneſſe; <hi>Suffer not any ſinne to reigne in thy mortall body; Rom.</hi> 6. thy body is the body of the Lord, it is under the power of Chriſt; therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As <hi>Luther</hi> doth report of one, that being tempted to any ſinne by the Devill, would anſwer, that ſhe was Chriſtian. Thy body is Chriſts by conqueſt, he hath diſpoſſeſſed the Devill of the ſtrong hold which he had in thy body, and therefore ſuffer not the Devill to rule there as he did when he was Lord of thee. If the Devill come, and tempt thee to commit any ſinne, which is a ſinne that thou mayſt act with thy body: anſwer him thus; Satan away, my eares can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be open to thy temptations, I cannot li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to thee to commit this ſinne, my body is not mine owne, but the body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And when thou findeſt thy ſelfe in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, at any time unwilling for the ſervice of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:180666:234"/>Chriſt, conſider with thy ſelfe, my body is not mine owne, it belongs to the Lord Chriſt, he will have a care of it at the reſurrection, he will not loſe my earth or aſhes, he will preſerve my duſt, and keep it as a precious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond in the casket of his owne love. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be willing to ſerve Chriſt in thy body; he ownes the bodies of Saints here, and will owne them hereafter; he hath a ſpeciall care of the bones of his Saints, and though the limbes of their bodies be carried from one end of the world to the other, and ſcattered in ſeverall places and climates, yet by his power he will bring one limb to another: therefore glorifie Chriſt in your bodies, who hath promiſed to quicken your mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by his ſpirit which he hath given unto you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, another uſe may be this, to make us willing to ſacrifice our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for the maintaining of the truths of Chriſt, if Chriſt be pleaſed to call us to ſuffer for him. We doe not know but this point may be very ſeaſonable; we know not how ſoone Chriſt may call for our bodies to lie in priſon, for ſome truthes he hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us which he hath not made known to others; why ſhould we be unwilling that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer in his owne body? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:180666:235"/>that the body which ſhall lie in priſon, it is not thy body, thou art not able to raiſe it, it is the body of Chriſt. Therefore if it be the mind of Chriſt that this body ſhall lie in priſon, <hi>ſay not, My will, but thy will</hi> be done; and if Chriſt will lead thee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he will not onely lead thee to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in thy body for the profeſſion of the truth: but if he call thee to give up thy life to looſe it for him, that thou mayſt find it again in him: let this conſideration make thee willing to be a martyr, and ſufferer for the Lord Chriſt; why ſhould not he doe what he will with his owne? If he will lead thee to a pillorie, to an hot Iron to receive a marke in thy body for him, to an halter fire, and faggot, be contented. And b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> confident, that if Chriſt ever call the to ſuffer, he will give thee power, and ſtrength, for to ſuffer in thy body; becauſe he cannot forget to be mindfull of his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. We know how Chriſt threatneth thoſe that are aſhamed of him, and his word, in an adulterous, and ſinfull generation, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. <hi>Of him</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed when he ſhall come in the glory of the Father, with power and great glory.</hi> As Chriſt will no owne but be aſhamed of wicked, ungodly and unbelieving men, that make profeſſion
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:180666:235"/>of his name in words, without his power in their hearts: ſo Chriſt will owne the bodies of his Saints, and ſuch who truly believe in him, and have laid downe their lives for him, and they ſhall find their lives againe at the reſurrection of the dead. Therefore let this make us willing to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>I am the more willing to preſſe this point, becauſe I ſee a ſpirit of baſeneſſe, and coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſſe in Chriſtians; I find not that courage in the hearts and ſpirits of Chriſtians that ſhould be in them.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:180666:236"/>as precious: but when they are told of a crucified Chriſt, of a perſecuted Chriſt, of Chriſt hanging on a tree; a Chriſt to be ſpit upon, condemned, and perſecuted, to ſuffer in the world: with the young man in the Goſpel, they goe away ſorrowfull from ſuch a Sermon; they would have Chriſt and the world together; but if they cannot have Chriſt, but they muſt leave the world, they had rather part with Chriſt then with the world. They are like <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> that tooke Chriſt, and left the Croſſe behind him; So, delicate Profeſſors in our time, they will take Chriſt, but they will be ſure to leave the Croſſe, they will be wiſe in their way, they will profeſſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no further then they may hold the world, and Religion together.</p>
                  <p>One reaſon of this cowardiſe and baſeneſſe of ſpirit is this, becauſe they doe not conſider, that the bodies of Saints are under the care and in the poſſeſſion of Jeſus. And that wee cannot glorifie God more then by lying in priſon, in love to Chriſt; or dying for him; if it be his pleaſure to call us, to ſeale his truths with our bloud: And if we did conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what a holy flame, and Heavenly ſparke was in the hearts and ſpirits of primitive Chriſtians, in believing this truth, that they

And the ground of this, is this, becauſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee doe not meditate on this truth, or elſe, becauſe we are rather cold, and formall, then truly ſpirituall in the meditation of it, which ſhould engage us as we tender the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt, to be more frequent and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in our contemplations, concerning it, for the future. I find that Chriſtians made much uſe of this point in former dayes, (though I doe not wholly juſtifie their practiſe) for as it is our cuſtome to ſalute one another, when we meete, ſo it was the cuſtome of ſome Chriſtians, when they met one another to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:180666:237"/>may give us ſpirituall and Heavenly wiſdome, that ſo we may have a more Divine and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall knowledge of it. He that is the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the life of Saints, is the onely teacher of the Doctrine of the reſurrection. It is reported of the Pelican, that her young being poyſoned by the Serpent, ſhe doth give them life, by her own death and bloud; ſo Chriſt doth quicken us his members to a life of immortality, by his owne death and bloud. And doth give us the knowledge of life in the knowledge of his death, bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedding and reſurrection, which doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the neceſſity of our reſurrection from his who is our head: And this is the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of true Saints. And as it is reported of the Phenix, that when ſhe is to die, ſhe brings ſpices into her neſt, which being ſet on fire, ſhe her ſelfe is burned in the fire, and turned to aſhes; and out of her aſhes comes a new Phenix; ſo a true Chriſtian knoweth, that though he may be burned, and turned into aſhes, yet out of his owne aſhes, his body ſhall be raiſed againe to a new life of glory, which doth arme him againſt the feare of death, and perſecution in the cauſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Again this doth diſcover what enemies they are to Chriſt his Spirit, and members, who by their wiles, ſubtilty and helliſh Logick
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:180666:238"/>would deſtroy the Doctrine of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: They would rob Chriſt of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who doth here lay claime to the bodies of dead Saints. They would make the Spirit a lier, who doth ſeale up Saints <hi>unto the day of Redemption, Eph.</hi> 5.30. And in whom <hi>they wait for the redemption of their bodies, Rom.</hi> 8.23. They would rob Saints of their comfort, which God doth give them, in the beleeving of the reſurrection of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is committed unto the earth. I am the more earneſt againſt theſe men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know theſe factors for Antichriſt, are both active and ſubtle; as the Serpent did indeavour to beguile <hi>Eve,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. ſo theſe indeavour to undermine men, and to draw them from the ſimplicity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. One, and a chiefe part of Chriſts ſimple Goſpel is the Doctrine of the reſurrection of our bodies, by the power of Chriſt: when <hi>Paul</hi> preached this at <hi>Athens,</hi> the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Epicures</hi> did look upon him as a babler. And this piece of the Goſpel was alwayes accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fooliſhneſſe to the learned Greeks.</p>
                  <p>And as the Apoſtle was jealous of them, for feare they ſhould be drawne from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel: ſo am I jealous over poore Chriſtians, knowing that you ſhall meet with men, that pretend to be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:180666:238"/>men of great light, wiſdome, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and deep underſtandings; and when you have dived into the bottome of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, this is all you ſhall find in them, which they will labour to draw you to aſſent unto, to wit, that there is no reſurrection but in the ſpirit, no corporall reſurrection of the body at all.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are like thoſe, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, in his time, that corrupt or deale deceitfully with the word of God. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor is borrowed from cheating Vintners, or couſening Merchants that adulterate their commodities to make them vendible, as <hi>Beza</hi> doth well obſerve: ſo theſe, that their horrid opinions and blaſphemies may be vendible, they endeavour <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to ſophiſticate the word, and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it from the plaine and ſimple meaning of the Holy-Ghoſt. Therefore let mee in love to your ſoules, once more deſire you, that you would be watchfull, that none of theſe draw you away from theſe truthes, of God, and the Lord Jeſus, which have been diſcovered to you, and have been ſealed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your hearts and ſpirits by his owne bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit. The Devill doth ſow the tares of Familiſme in mens hearts while they ſleep. But I am confident, that you ſhall believe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:180666:239"/>them, though for a time you may be drawn to queſtion them and the reſurrection, as thoſe in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and may be deluded by Familiſticall fancies, and notions, as ſome good Chriſtians have been, yet if God hath laid hold on you, and drawne you to him in Chriſt, he will not totally leave you to theſe damnable opinions: <hi>If it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, theſe Serpents would deceive even the Elect:</hi> but Chriſt intimates, that it is impoſſible, that they ſhould ever deceive the Elect. And the Apoſtle, when he ſpeakes of ſuch men as theſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. ſaith that <hi>the foundation of the Lord ſtands ſure, having this ſeale,</hi> of his everlaſting election, <hi>the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> Therefore let not men deceive you, but live in the light of the Goſpel, and in that Spirit that is given forth in the Goſpel. Take heed of theſe Impoſtors, hug not the Devill in <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle: ſuffer not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill to devoure you in a ſheeps skin: but walke in the plaine ſimple path of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Lord Chriſt. And that you may doe this, give me leave to give you ſome few directions, for the preſerving you in the truth, and the ſecuring of you from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Familiſme.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I wiſh you to apply your ſelves to the reading of the Scriptures, <hi>which are able to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:180666:239"/>make you wiſe unto ſalvation, through Faith which is in Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.15. When theſe men come unto you, it may be they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you with bookes written in a ſtrange Language, ſtuffed with ſwelling non-ſenſe, and affected phraſes that none underſtand, but thoſe that are acquainted with their blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, horrid, and damnable opinions. And will indeavour to lead you from the Scriptures; and if yous oppoſe the truth of Scripture againſt their deluſion, ſome of them will affirme, that <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> when they wrote their Epiſtles, had but a little light, were but children; they are enlightned men, growne up unto the ſtature of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, labouring to prove that the bright ſtarre of truth doth ſhine no where ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly as in the old Popiſh Authors, and new Familiſticall ſcriblers, which they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto you. Therefore that you may not be drawne away by theſe, keep to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and know that there is no booke in which there is more light then in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or from which you may expect more light, if you looke to God for his ſpirit, to open the mind of God in the reading of it.
<q>Dulcius ex ipſo fonte bibuntur aquae.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Waters are ſweeteſt at the well-head: And
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:180666:240"/>truthes doe preſent themſelves moſt ſweetly unto us, in the Scripture, which is the Well and Fountaine, from which other Writers doe fetch the truthes, which we find in their writings. He that addicts himſelfe more to the reading of mens writings then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is like one, that leaving the Fountaine where the waters are pure, had rather drink in the channell where they are impure and muddy.</p>
                  <p>Truly, if you grow in grace, you will grow in liking, and approving the holy Scripture, though it be written in a plaine ſtyle, and though there be not that humane Eloquence, and Rhetorick in it, which you ſhall find in the preaching of ſome men, who preach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rather then the Lord Jeſus, and the ſimplicity of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>That man is a good proficient in the Schoole of Chriſt, that every day growes more, and more in love with the bleſſed, and holy Scripture. I remember what an Orator ſpeaking in the commendation of <hi>Cicero</hi> faith, he is a good proficient in Oratorie, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to read the Orations of <hi>Cicero;</hi> ſo he is a good proficient in Chriſtianity, that in believing, delights in the holy Scriptures of the Old, and New Teſtament. Therefore you ſhall find, that men that fall off to theſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:180666:240"/>opinions, preſently they ſlight the Scripture, and either wholly deny the word of God, or elſe they overthrow the truth of it by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorizing thoſe things that have a plain, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hiſtoricall meaning in them. That is the firſt Rule.</p>
                  <p>Search the Scriptures, and there you ſhall ſee no ſuch fancies, and fond notions as theſe men have.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond direction is this, take heed of thoſe that preach not the Goſpel in a plaine familiar way, you may know ſome Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts by their bombaſtick language: they ſpeake not in the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in their Sermons: but they have an affected language of their owne, (that few under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but thoſe that have applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much to the ſtudie of their writings, and are well acquainted with their opinions,) And by their chymical darke expreſſions, and fond notions, they delude poore ſoules that thinke they are ſpirituall men, and that great things are revealed to them which are not diſcovered to other Saints; when there is nothing but horrid Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, or Atheiſme, lies at the bottome of their hearts, which ſhall be evident, when according to the truth of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Their folly ſhall be manifest unt all men.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:180666:241"/>Paul</hi> ſaith, when he came to preach at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. <hi>That it was not in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of ſpeech, nor in the enticing words of mans wiſdome, but in plainneſſe of ſpeech, in demonſtration of the Spirit and power.</hi> And it is the command of God, <hi>that if any man ſpeake, he ſhould ſpeake as the Oracles of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. The <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>As</hi> doth relate to the manner of ſpeaking, as well as to the matter which is to be delivered. Men are to ſpeake, as the Oracles of God, ſpeaking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth; and as the Oracles of God for plainneſſe of ſpeech. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of true Goſpel-Preachers, ſaith, we uſe great plainneſſe of ſpeech. The Scripture is in a plaine, familiar ſtyle, the Sermons of our Saviour are plaine, familiar Sermons, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with plaine ſimilies. And the Apoſtles were not aſhamed to imitate their Maſter: ſo ſhould our diſcourſes be with <hi>all plainnes of ſpeech &amp; demonſtration of the ſpirit &amp; power,</hi> that the glory may be given not to the Eloquence of our tongues, but to the power of Chriſt in converting of ſoules. Therefore take heed of thoſe, that lead you from the plainneſſe of preaching, hiding their curſed errours in a thicket and cloud of darke workes, and unſcripture-like expreſſions, not holding faſt the forme of ſound words according to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:180666:241"/>Gods precept, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12. Looke on the Scripture, and ſee how <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of Juſtification, of remiſſion of ſinnes, of the reſurrection, and ſo let us preach the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the truth of Chriſt. But thoſe that have language not like the language of Scripture ſuſpect them, they make a faire ſhew, there is great glory, and outward pompe in their words: but <hi>latet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis,</hi> there is a ſnake that lies under theſe fine greene herbes: take heed of ſuch men, and looke more for the inward power and Spirit of God in the ſpeaking of men, then for fine words, phraſes, notions, and ſimilies, that men may make uſe of, to winne you to the approbation of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
                  <p>The third direction which I ſhall preſent unto you is this, take heed of ſpirituall pride: for one reaſon why ſo many fall off from the truth to theſe horrid opinions, is from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſpirituall pride; ſome of theſe thought that they had a great deale of knowledge, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and underſtanding, and that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as much of the Doctrine of Chriſt, and myſteries of the Goſpel as was neceſſary; that they had heard as much of the Doctrine of Juſtification as any could preach of it, and of the reſurrection, as any could ſpeake:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:180666:242"/>they knew as they ſuppoſed what this man ſpake, and what the other preached, what this mans judgement was, what Authors did write, and they knew perfectly as they imagined whatſoever lies in the Scripture to be embraced for truth. And by their pride did ſurfeit of their knowledge, ſuppoſing that they knew all points of the Goſpel, when in deed and in truth, they knew nothing of the Goſpel ſavingly, ſpiritually, or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: ſo that as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to loath <hi>Manna,</hi> and luſted after other food: ſo theſe being puffed up with ſpirituall pride, begin to loath the Heavenly <hi>Manna</hi> of the Goſpel, and diſeſteeme it for the plainneſſe, and ſimplicity that is in it. And nothing now will pleaſe them but new fancies: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt have Sermons dreſſed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other faſhion, new cooked, new notions; and new conceits, and any thing that is new pleaſeth them better then the old and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent truths of the Lord Jeſus. But when God teacheth a man to underſtand the Goſpel aright, the more he knowes the Goſpel, the more he ſees his ignorance of the Goſpel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Sanctification: this man lookes not on his
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:180666:242"/>knowledge meerely as it is ſpeculative, but as it is practicall, when he ſees any unbeliefe in his heart, he ſaith within himſelfe, I have not ſufficiently learned the Doctrine of Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: when he ſees any hatred in his ſpirit, to that which is good, and any inclination to that which is evill, he wiſely concludeth, I have not ſufficiently lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Doctrine of Sanctification; when he finds ſadneſſe in his ſpirit, O ſaith he, there is more in the Goſpel concerning the ſpirit of joy, and conſolation, then I have attained to; when he reads ſundry enigmaticall, and difficult places, of the Prophets, and in the Revelation, and hath not attained to the ſpirituall meaning of them, O (ſaith he) I am not ſufficiently acquainted with the truths which lie hidden in the word: though I may have knowledge enough to carrie me to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet I am very ignorant of many truths of Chriſt. Thus a man that truely lives the life of Faith, he is not puffed up, as theſe are, that fall to theſe hideous, and blaſphemous notions, and opinions. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. <hi>He that is lifted up, his heart is not upright: but the juſt ſhall live by his Faith.</hi> You ſhall find that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliſticall ſpirits are puffed up with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their knowledge, notions, and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, when indeed they are wholy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:180666:243"/>and underſtand not the deepe things of Gods grace in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. But he that truly walks with God faithfully, that man walks humbly with his God.</p>
                  <p>True Faith as it exalts us, and ſhewes us our priviledges, and honour by the grace of God in Chriſt; ſo it humbles us by the ſight of what is in our ſelves. The light of grace will as well diſcover, what wee are in our fleſhly part, as what wee are by the grace of God in the ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And theſe that are thus enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhall never fall totally and finally from the pure and ſimple Goſpel of Chriſt: the Spirit in them doth aſſure them that they ſhall abide in him, <hi>John</hi> 2.27. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of pride, the bane of Angels, and the ruine of men, and the mother of Familiſme. But grow in humility; conceit not that you are full when you are empty. As long as the Widow had empty veſſels, the oyle did ſtill run, ſo, as long as there is an empty veſſel in thy heart, the oyle of grace ſhall flow in unto thee.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Direction. Take heed that thou doſt not embrace the Doctrines of free will, and falling away from grace, ſome of the Familiſts of the City, have been great ſticklers to uphold theſe points, and to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:180666:243"/>revive Arminian Tenets among Profeſſors, before they did arrive to the top and height of Familiſme. That man will not ſtand long, who hath no ſtrength, but his owne legs to uphold him. Neither will that man ſtand long for Chriſt, who ſtands more by the ſtrength of his owne will, then by the power of Gods grace. <hi>Adam</hi> ſtanding in his owne ſtrength, loſt his happineſſe when he was wiſe and righteous; and canſt thou maintaine thy ſelfe in an happy condition by thine owne ſtrength, when thou art unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? True Saints <hi>are kept by the power of God through Faith unto ſalvation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſignifieth a keeping of any thing as by a Guard. Gods grace is a guard, by which he doth keepe all his, in the way of ſalvation, ſo that it is impoſſible they ſhould fall away from his grace. It is no wonder then, if they fall way from grace, to Familiſme, who doe maintaine that Saints may fall away from grace.</p>
                  <p>The fift Direction. Be not looſe or licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in life, or neglective of Sanctification under the profeſſion of the Doctrines of Free-grace and Juſtification. Many of the profeſſed Familiſts which we meet with have been looſe Profeſſors of the Doctrine of Grace. The Libertine doth live next dore
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:180666:244"/>to the Familiſt, and Libertiniſme is the broad road, and high-way, or beaten-path to Familiſme.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, take heed of vaine janglings, and diſputings in matters of Religion. Religion is more in practiſe, then Controverſies or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. Be more conſcientious to practiſe what thou knoweſt, then curious in diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about things that thou knoweſt not. And let thine eare be rather open to thoſe that will inſtruct thee, then to thoſe that will diſpute with thee.</p>
                  <p>The Diſputes and Controverſies of the times have made many Atheiſts and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, in theſe times. <hi>Origen</hi> ſpeaking of theſe words in the 21. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. <hi>If men ſtrive and hurt a woman with child, ſo that her fruit depart from her, &amp;c.</hi> doth thus allegorize them. The woman with child ſaith he, are weake Chriſtians, who are with child and ready to bring forth truth. The men that ſtrive are Profeſſors, that with bitterneſſe and violence doe contend for their opinions, and while they ſtrive in heat and bitterneſſe for their opinions, the Chriſtian miſcarries, and doth not bring forth truth.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ſhewed unto you, that theſe words are a preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or cordiall, given by God unto his people, for the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their languiſhing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſad hearts in the midſt of their afflictions. And have proved that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:180666:246"/>of the Saints ſhall ariſe, and that they ſhall ariſe as the body of the Lord Jeſus. He is their head; they ſhall riſe as his men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. He dyed to bring his people to a ſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall oneneſſe, with himſelfe, and his Father. They are his poſſeſſion, and inheritance. And as a body may properly be called the body of that ſoule which doth informe it: ſo Chriſt ſhall be the ſpirituall forme, and ſoule to thoſe that ſhal be raiſed at the great day of the generall reſurrection. By theſe and other ſpirituall conſiderations, I did evidence this truth, that the bodies of the Saints ſhall he raiſed, as the dead bodie of their bleſſed Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. <hi>My dead body ſhall they riſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall now by the Aſſiſtance of Gods grace, briefly open unto you, the words that follow in the Text, and make choyſe of one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from them, which may heighten your ſpirituall joy this day, upon which I ſhall enlarge my ſelfe, and ſo ſhall commend you and what I ſhall deliver to you, to the bleſſing of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>The next word which doth preſent it ſelfe to us in the Text, is this, <hi>Awake,</hi> which doth afford us this obſervation, that Death is but a ſleep. It is night for a time with the Saints, while they ſleep in their graves, but they ſhall awake at the morning of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:180666:246"/>
               <p>The grave is a bed of reſt, perfumed, and made ſweet to all Saints by the death of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way whatſoever is bitter, and unpleaſant in it. It is no longer a curſe to the Saints, but rather a part of their happineſſe, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, Rev.</hi> 14.4.13. As the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>When I awake I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> that is, at the great day of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; after I have had a long ſleep in the duſt, when the night is paſt, and the day of the reſurrection ſhall ſhine, <hi>I ſhall awake, and then I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſſe, Iſa.</hi> 57.2. The Prophet hath an expreſſion that runnes this way; ſpeaking of righteous and mercifull men, (ſaith he) <hi>they ſhall enter into peace; they ſhall reſt in their beds.</hi> And when <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned to death, the Holy Ghoſt telleth us that he fell aſleep, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.60. And the Primitive Chriſtians called the places where they buried their dead <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſleeping places. The Earth to every Saint is but a ſleeping place. Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come downe from Heaven with a ſhout, and with the voyce of the Arch-angel, and with the Trump of God. And this great Trumpet being blown, <hi>the dead in Christ ſhall awake and riſe.</hi> He that dyeth in Chriſt, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:180666:247"/>is one of his dead men, doth not dye but ſleep. And at the reſurrection ſhal in a moment awake out of his ſleep. When the Father, Word, and Spirit did make the Fabrick of the world, all things were ſpeedily, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly made; for the making of any thing, there was but <hi>verbum &amp; factum;</hi> the word ſpoken, and preſently the thing was made <hi>Let there be Light, and there was light, let there be a firmament, and there was a firmament:</hi> ſo when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall ſpeake the word, and bid us awake; in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, thoſe that are dead in the Lord, ſhall awake out of the ſleep of death.</p>
               <p>And here by the way, let me give you another obſervation. You ſee at the great day that the dead that lye in the duſt ſhall be raiſed by the command of Chriſt, who ſhall bid them come out of the duſt. Now, as no rational man would conclude from this place, that the dead (who it may be, have their duſt lying in ſeverall places, in every part of the world a portion of their duſt,) have any power to raiſe themſelves, though they are bid to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake: even ſo when God ſpeaking to ſoule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that heare the word preached, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to believe, repent, live holily, and rejoyce, we cannot conclude, that there is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:180666:247"/>any power, ſtrength, and ability in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to doe what they are commanded to doe; no more then the dead can awake of themſelves, though Chriſt commands them to awake. As when Chriſt did bid <hi>Lazarus</hi> come forth of the grave, he did preſently come forth; though he had not any power in himſelfe to come forth; but that power that bid him come forth, enabled him to come forth; ſo, though Chriſt exhort us in the Goſpel to believe, and to doe good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we have no power in our ſelves to doe good duties, but that power that bids us doe good duties, muſt inable us to doe them, or elſe we are never able to doe them: which moved <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to pray thus; <hi>Da domine quod jubes, &amp; jube quod vis,</hi> give Lord what thou commandeſt, and command what thou wilt. Againe, in the next place take notice, that thoſe who ſhall be raiſed are called the inhabitants of the duſt, <hi>yee that dwell in the duſt,</hi> the duſt for a time is a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for the Saints: in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.5. It is ſaid, <hi>Man ſhall goe to his long home.</hi> The grave is a home, or houſe for a time, which may aſſure us of the reſurrection of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which are entruſted to the duſt, that which dwelleth in the duſt, and no other thing in ſtead of it, muſt be be raiſed out of the duſt.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:180666:248"/>
               <p>Thirdly, here is a reaſon laid downe in the next verſe to aſſure us of our reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Thy dew is as the dew of Herbes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus, in the power of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſhall be as a heavenly dew, upon the dead bodies and duſt of the Saints, to raiſe them up, and quicken them to a new life. Chriſt in the power of his Spirit may be compared to dew for three reaſons; firſt, becauſe as the dew comming downe upon the earth, the earth bringeth forth graſſe without the help, and labour of man, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5.7. ſo, without the labour, and ſtrength of the creature, the Lord Jeſus, the dew of Heaven, coming down upon the duſt and aſhes of the Saints, ſhall quicken them to a life, and make them flouriſh after they have layen rotting, and moldering in the grave.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the dew doth come down ſpeedily, and ſuddenly upon the earth, as you may gather from that expreſſion of <hi>Huſhai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> in that ſpeech of his to <hi>Abſalom</hi> concerning <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.12. <hi>We will come upon him in ſome place where he ſhall be found, and light or him as the dew falleth upon the ground.</hi> As the dew falls ſuddenly, and unexpectedly, ſo w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> will ſurpriſe <hi>David.</hi> So the Lord Jeſus will come in the <hi>twinkling of an eye;</hi> ſuddenly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bodies of the Saints. Therefore h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:180666:248"/>compares his comming to the comming of a thiefe in the night; and to lightning, which we know is darted through the middeſt of Heaven with great volubilitie, and ſwiftneſſe. In the third place; Chriſt ſhall be as dew: becauſe as dew doth make the herbs on which it falls to be fruitfull, and to waxe green and flouriſh, after they have ſeemed to be dead: So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall quicken the dead carkaſſes of his Saints, and put a life into their duſt. Thus <hi>Moſes,</hi> the holy ſervant of God, ſpeaking of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in reference to the flouriſhing of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2. (ſaith) <hi>that his Doctrine ſhall drop as the raine, and his ſpeech ſhall diſtill as the dew, as the ſmall raine upon the tender herb, and as the ſhowers upon the graſſe.</hi> As the dew of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven makes the things upon which it falls, fruitfull, and fertile: ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, falling downe upon the duſt, and aſhes, upon the rotten bones, putrifyed car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes, and skuls of the Saints, ſhall cauſe them to flouriſh, and to ſpring up, and they ſhall have a new life put into them by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omming downe upon them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Prophet ſaith, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arth ſhall caſt out her dead; from whence we may ſtrongly conclude, the reſurrection <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f the ſame body which is caſt into the earth,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:180666:249"/>That body which was dead and buried i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the earth, ſhall be raiſed out of the earth. But I have ſufficiently ſpoken of theſe points, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> my former diſcourſes. So that if I ſhould ſpeal from all theſe particulars, I ſhould rather repeat what I have ſaid, then preſent you with new matter. The thing therefore that I ſhall open unto you to day, for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your joy ſhall be this; to ſhew you what great joy there ſhall be, at the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the dead, which is held forth in theſe words.
<q>Awake, and ſing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I doe make bold to finiſh this ſubject her among you this day, becauſe I know no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> whether I ſhall have an opportunity to ſpeak to you againe from theſe words. And ſeeing I have handled the two former parts in this place, I had a deſire to finiſh my diſcourſe from this Text among you.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon was, becauſe I did find ſome Familiſticall ſpirits here, that were troubled with what I delivered: being ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to that Chriſt, who came in the fleſh and dyed on the Croſſe, &amp; was raiſed from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> dead, and enemies to the Doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, which is to be wrought by his power; and that you may ſee, how little I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the ſpeeches of theſe enemies of Chriſt,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:180666:249"/>and the glorious reſurrection of Saints, I would not ſeeme for their ſakes to deſert my diſcourſe: therefore I did reſolve to goe on with it this day.</p>
               <p>Then thirdly, I apprehend it may much further the worke of the day; for if we have remembred God aright in our prayſes; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made mention of his goodneſſe to the Land, and Nation, we have done it ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and have more rejoyced in ſpirituall then temporall mercies. And if our joy ſhould end in rejoycing only for teporal mercies, we ſhould rejoyce rather carnally then ſpiritually. Therefore having in the beginning of the day rejoyced for the mercies that God hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Land, I thinke I ſhall doe well, if I raiſe you in your ſpirits by what I ſhall ſpeake from theſe words, and from the ſight of Nationall mercies, and temporall delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances take occaſion to draw your eyes to behold by Faith, how you and all Saints ſhall rejoyce when you are delivered from all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at the reſurrection: that ſo I may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate your joy, by carrying you higher in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he ſpirit, to rejoice in the ſpirituall things ſpoken of in the text.
<q>Awake, and ſing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ye know we expreſſe our joy by ſinging, as we may gather from that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.1.

                  </gap> which point, I ſhall ſhew you what cauſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> rejoycing, there will be at the reſurrection.</p>
               <p>The ſpirits, and the bodies of the Saints will then be reunited together again, which were diſunited for many yeares. And as the Spirit doth with ſome regret, griefe, and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe leave the bodie, having a natural deſire, and appetite (being planted into it, by the hand of the Creator) after union with the bodie, ſo, the ſpirit cannot but rejoyce when it is united againe to the bodie.

We that are in this Tabernacle (ſaith he) <hi>groane,</hi> being burthened; not for that we would be <hi>uncloathed,</hi> but <hi>cloathed upon, that mortality might be ſwallowed up of life.</hi> There ſeemes in theſe words to be held forth an unwillingnes in the Saints, to be uncloathed of their bodies, to put off the cloathing of the fleſh. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in Philoſophie, that there is a naturall appetite in the ſoule, or forme to be united to that bodie that it once informed: and as it leaves the bodie with ſome unwillingneſſe, ſo there is a deſire of reunion when they are parted, ſo that re-union will be a cauſe of joy. For as there is joy at the meeting of friends, ſo the body and ſoule that were long together in this world, ſhall rejoyce when they ſhall meet together againe. This is one ground of joy from their meeting: the bodie and the ſpirit ſhall meet together, there ſhall be a reunion after there hath been a diſunion between them.</p>
               <p>But in the next place, there will be a cauſe of great joy: becauſe there will be an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfection, both in the body, and in the ſoule. God ſhall be perfection in the Spirit in

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:180666:252"/>and the brightneſſe of the firmament is a great glory to our eyes; ſo there ſhall be a Celeſtiall, Star-like glory upon the bodies of the Saints; they ſhall not be groſſe, lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, and heavie bodies as they are now: but ſpirituall bodies, as ſwift as a Seraphim. The bodie is now a clog and weight to the ſoule, it is <hi>ergaſtulum animae</hi> as the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> ſay, it keepeth the ſpirit under, and preſſeth it down with the weight of it, but then the bodie ſhall be a ſpirituall body: ſo that in this body the Saints ſhall aſcend into the aire, as in a Charriot of triumph, and glory, to meet the Lord Jeſus. As <hi>Elias</hi> was carried up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo ſhall the Saints in theſe bodies of theirs rife in glorie, to meet the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the ayre. Now they are ſubject to diſeaſes: then they ſhall be freed from all diſeaſes; now they are ſubject to death; then death ſhall be ſwallowed up, and every Saint in his owne perſon ſhall appeare as a Conquerour of death, and of the grave; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Saint ſhall have this <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:180666:253"/>Kings with the Lord Jeſus?</p>
               <p>Againe, there will be great joy: becauſe all things that may occaſion any ſorrow or ſadneſſe ſhall be quite removed away: all teares muſt then be wiped from the eyes of all the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.17. there muſt be no more ſighing; no more griefe; no more ſorrow. All earthly infirmities and weakneſſes, which are accompanied with griefe and paine, ſhall be removed: for our bodies ſhall be <hi>Celeſtiall bodies,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.40.) <hi>raiſed up in incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42. And there ſhall be no more blindneſſe or blackneſſe upon our ſpirits.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:180666:254"/>ſenſe, feeling, and apprehenſion, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sanctification. There ſhall be no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then in the ſoule, ſpirit, or body for any luſt, or uncleanneſſe, and conſequently no place for ſorrow. Sinne is like the evill ſpirit that poſſeſſed <hi>Saul,</hi> that made him melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and ſad, and afflicted him in his ſpirit. But when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, then all ſinne ſhall be done away to our ſenſe, and feeling, as it is done away now in our Juſtification. Then we ſhall be as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſanctified throughout, both in bodie and ſpirit, as wee are now perfectly juſtified. Now the life that wee live in the fleſh is by Faith in the Sonne of God, by ſeeing how compleatly we are juſtified from ſinnes, luſts, corruptions, thoſe enemies to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt that wee carrie in our boſomes: but then wee ſhall be as perfect in reſpect of the life of ſanctification, as wee are now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and compleat in reſpect of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. So that the cauſe of ſorrow, and trouble ſhall quite be taken away.</p>
               <p>There ſhall be no place then left for Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall ſorrow; the ſorrow that now is wrought in the Saints is Evangelicall, not Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall; but the joy, and glory which doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for the Saints hereafter ſhall be ſo great, that there ſhall be no place then left
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:180666:254"/>for Evangelicall griefe for any ſinne, that we have committed. And as ſin ſhall not then bring any ſorrow upon us, ſo neither ſhall the Devill, who is the troubler of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, be able to afflict us. Here he is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to afflict us, as he did <hi>Job,</hi> for the tryall of our Faith and patience; and though for the preſent, when we looke on Chriſt in his perſon, we ſee that wee are conquerours over the Devill in him, yet we meet with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, his fierie temptations, darts and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, which he ſhooteth into our ſpirits: ſo that he oft-times cauſeth us to walke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſadly, occaſioning troubles, which <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> calleth <hi>(tempeſtates mentis)</hi> the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts of the mind. As <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that he was buffeted by the meſſenger of Satan. But then this wicked Fiend ſhall be ſo chained up, that he ſhall never be let looſe upon us again. Then he ſhall be ſo under our feet that hee ſhall never have any liberty given him to tempt us any more.</p>
               <p>The <hi>accuſer of the Brethren is caſt out</hi> of heaven, <hi>Revelation</hi> 12.10. His accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and complaints againſt them cannot be heard by the eare of God, to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice their Juſtification, but he doth <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the woman</hi> upon the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.13. He afflicts the Church and brings much
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:180666:255"/>trouble oft-times to the Saints: but at the generall reſurrection, we ſhall be freed whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Devill, from all temptations, from all troubles, all enemies that can be thought upon: ſo that then things ſhall be fully accompliſhed, and compleated for our good. The Apoſtle though he telleth us that Chriſt for the preſent hath <hi>aboliſhed death</hi> and ſinne to us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. and <hi>deſtroyed him, who hath the power of death, who is the Devill, Heb.</hi> 2.14. yet he informeth us that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God made to us in Chriſt are not fully accompliſhed, compleated, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted till the reſurrection; as wee may ſee by that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. then ſhall be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that ſaying, ſpeaking of the reſurrection day, <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> then if ſhall be ſaid, <hi>O death where is thy ſting? O grave where is thy victory?</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Then ſhall it be, that is, it ſhall be, in the full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment; wee have now what is there promiſed, in the promiſe of God by Faith; then wee ſhall have what is in the promiſe, in the actuall fruition of the thing promiſed. So that in this reſpect, there will be great joy: becauſe then every Saint ſhall ride in a Chariot of triumph, as a Conquerour of all enemies in his own perſon. And as Chriſt in his owne body, and Spirit did ride to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:180666:255"/>and triumph over the power of Hell, Death, ſinne, curſe, and condemnation; and as the life that we live for the preſent, is by beholding this victory of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with the eye of Faith: ſo at the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reſurrection all the Saints ſhall imitate the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall ride as Conquerours triumphing over all enemies, and ſhall live the life of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing the ſame thing done in their owne perſons, which now by Faith they ſee done for them in the perſon of Jeſus. So that all cauſe and occaſion of trouble, and ſorrow being taken away, there muſt needs be great joy at the reſurrection of thoſe, who are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Lord.</p>
               <p>In the next place, as the occaſions and cauſes of all ſorrow ſhall be taken away; ſo likewiſe all things, all objects that may move ſpirituall joy ſhall be preſented to the Saints, to raiſe their ſpirits to a ſpirituall joy, who ſhall be raiſed and made happy with the Lord Jeſus: whatſoever it be that can be thought upon that can make any one happy, that the Saints ſhal enjoy: they ſhal enjoy God in a full meaſure, and the Lord Jeſus. Sweet ſtreames of joy will flow into their ſpirits, becauſe God will make himſelfe the Author and worker of their joy. <hi>Sing O daughter oſ Sion,</hi>

               <p>If there be ſuch rejoycing here in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Saint, when he hath a light from God
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:180666:256"/>to ſee ſomething of God in the face of Chriſt; what ſpirituall joy ſhall there be when our joy ſhall be at the full. If there be ſuch joy in the ebbing of the Spirit here, what joy will there be when we ſhall enjoy the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyde of the Spirit in the viſion of Gods grace, and glory hereafter; when wee ſhall eat of the tree of life; when wee ſhall drinke our fill of thoſe rivers of pleaſures which runne in the Paradiſe of God? And if there be ſo much ſweetneſſe in ſpirituall joy here; what tongue can expreſſe, or heart conceive what there ſhall be in that joy that ſhall be hereafter? Great, glorious and high are the expreſſions by which Saints doe ſet forth the joyes that they feele here, but no Saint can tell what the joyes ſhall be hereafter at the reſurrection. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.19. <hi>In the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my thoughts within mee, thy comforts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my ſoule;</hi> the delight is ſuch here, that <hi>David</hi> had rather have the light of Gods countenance, in a Spirit of joy upon him, then to enjoy all the glory and great things in the world. <hi>Thou haſt put greater joy into my heart, then when the corne and wine of</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men is <hi>increaſed, Pſal.</hi> 4. and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. <hi>One day in thy houſe is worth a thouſand.</hi> If there be ſuch joy in the preſence of God here, in the beholding of his grace, in the kiſſes of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:180666:257"/>his mouth, in the imbraces of his Sonne, when he doth now ſprinkle us with his grace; O what joy ſhall there be, when God ſhall poure out the Spirit of grace, and ſweetneſſe into our ſoules? when he ſhall open all the treaſures of his Spirit and love; when hee ſhall more freely and fully ſhew us the things, that <hi>neither eye hath ſeene, nor eare hath heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive what they are?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Wee have ſeene great things in the world; Crownes, Scepters, riches, worldly pomp and glory, but what are all theſe things? they doe not ſhadow forth the things that wee ſee here in the Spirit, and ſhall more plainely ſee hereafter. Our fancies, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, worke beyond our eye, we fancie greater things, then we behold: but what <hi>eye hath not ſeene, nor eare hath heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive,</hi> what they are, wee darkly ſee here, and ſhall fully enjoy hereafter.</p>
               <p>The Poets in their fancies, have fancied golden Mountaines, and great things; the earth doth not afford ſuch things as they have fancied and minted in their poeticall braines: but the things that ſhall then be diſcovered to us, goe beyond the cogitation and thought, and workings of mans heart,

Wee ſhall ſee God ours, and Chriſt ours, and all the glory of Heaven ours, and ſee our ſelves in the Kingdome of Heaven. So that there ſhall be the preſence of all things that ſhall make us happy, the confluence of all good things that can bring any bliſſe, tranquillity, and joy to the ſpirit, and ſoule of man. So that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there will be great joy, if wee conſider that there will be every thing wanting, that may make us ſorrowfull, and every thing preſent that may make us joyfull: there will be the abſence of all evill, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all good: there will be God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who is the <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> the chiefe good; and this God will unvaile himſelfe, and ſhew forth his love, and ſhine forth in his glorie, beautie, and excellency on the ſpirits of his people; and ſeeing themſelves in this happie, and blisfull condition; they cannot but ſing and rejoyce at the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>Againe, that I may bring you back to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what the worke of the day is, and enlarge my ſelfe upon that, at which I pointed even now; we know that we uſe to have great joy for great deliverances; When God hath ſuffered us, even to come to the brinke of ruine, and deſtruction, and then doth pull us from it, and ſave us, there is joy with ſhouting. We know how neere wee were to ruine, wee had almoſt been deſtroyed by the enemies that roſe up againſt us: but the Lord hath delivered us: and ſeriouſly conſidering this deliverance wee cannot but be thankfull and joyfull for the mercy. And our joy for the mercy of this day, may imperfectly ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow forth, and repreſent unto you the joy which ſhall be in Saints at the reſurrection. For wee that were compaſſed about with ſo many enemies in the world; that had all the Devills in hell againſt us, and all the wicked men in the world, holding forth their hands, to draw us and lead us into the broad way that leads to deſtruction: and a baſe malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant party that wee carrie about us, within our ſelves joyning with the Devill, the world, &amp; wicked men againſt our ſelves; by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God ſhall we be preſerved from all theſe enemies, and made more then Conquerours
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:180666:259"/>over all our enemies through Jeſus Chriſt, that loved us. And ſo ſhall have cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in our preſervation and deliverance.</p>
               <p>Truely we are not able fully to apprehend our deliverance here, and that is the reaſon that Saints rejoyce ſo little in the God of grace and his mercies. We cannot apprehend fully what it is to be freed from ſinne, that hath layed the foundation of Hell. Wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not, what it is to be in the hands, and jawes of the Prince of darkneſſe, and then to be pulled out of his hands, and jawes by Chriſt; as <hi>David</hi> recovered his Lamb out of the mouth of the Lyon, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.34. Wee doe not apprehend what it is to be by nature children of wrath, and yet to be crowned with grace, glory, and immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, through the goodneſſe of God; but then we ſhall fully apprehend our great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances by the grace of God, and the power of the Lamb, and ſhall ſing for joy. In the 15. of the <hi>Rev.</hi> the 3. it is ſaid of Saints that <hi>they ſing the ſong of Moſes,</hi> wee ſing it here in the ſpirit, in part, believing with <hi>Zacharias</hi> that wee are delivered out of the hand of our enemies; but then we ſhall ſing it fully, in the fulneſſe of ſpirituall joy. It is called the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe it ſhall be a ſong for their deliverance out of the hand of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:180666:259"/>all enemies. As <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were delivered from <hi>Egypt</hi> called the people to play upon Muſick, and ſing prayſe to God, ſo that the Heavens anſwered, and ecchoed to their ſinging, and the joyfull noyſe, that they made to God for their deliverance: So when wee ſhall apprehend that the Lord by his mighty power hath delivered us from the Egyptian <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Devill; from the houſe of bondage, the Iron furnace of <hi>Egypt;</hi> from the ſting of ſinne, from the power of darkneſſe, from all curſes, and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; from temporall, ſpirituall, and eternall death; being fully apprehenſive of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, wee cannot but be filled with joy in ſinging prayſes to him who is our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer.</p>
               <p>When by the crueltie of <hi>Haman,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were appointed for ſlaughter and deſtruction; and God had given in a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deliverance to them; we read how they kept the day with joy, <hi>Heſter</hi> 9.22. The day was called a day <hi>wherein the Jewes reſted from their enemies, and the moneth which was turned unto them from ſorrow to joy, and from mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a good day; that they ſhould make them dayes of feaſting, and joy, and of ſending porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons one to another, and gifts to the poore.</hi> The Devill like <hi>Haman</hi> had appointed the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:180666:260"/>of God to ſlaughter, and deſtruction; he thought to have ſwallowed them up, and to have made them as miſerable to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie as he himſelfe ſhall be: but by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and power of God they are delivered from this ſpirituall <hi>Haman.</hi> The Lord hath raiſed up a <hi>Mordecai,</hi> the Lord Jeſus, who hath given us a deliverance from him. As <hi>Mordecai</hi> did ſpeake <hi>peace</hi> to his people, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 10.3. So Jeſus Chriſt our ſpirituall <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi> ſhall ſpeake <hi>peace</hi> to us, bring delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to his people, diſcover the plots, and machinations of our enemies, by which they would have wrought our ruine, and deſtruction, and the Saints that were as ſheep appointed for the ſlaughter, by cruell <hi>Haman</hi> the enemy of mankind, ſhall eſcape out of the hands of this bloudy Lyon, out of the ſnare of this cruell hunter; which will afford plentifully matter of great joy, and ſinging to the Saints.</p>
               <p>But in the next place there is cauſe of great joy, when people are not only delivered from their enemies, but their enemies are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe put under their feet, (as God by his goodneſſe ſeemes to doe ours this day: who are brought to a low and helpleſſe condition, unleſſe the Devill help them with a new plot, and make them as ſtrong as formerly they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:180666:260"/>were) ſo it will be with Saints at the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; we apprehend it matter of joy to us, that God hath not onely delivered us from the hands of our enemies; but hath given us the necks of our enemies likewiſe: ſo that we are Conquerours of them that hoped to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer us; they are under our command, that thought to have made us ſlaves, and vaſſals to the commands of their imperious, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell luſts. So there will be rejoycing at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, becauſe as <hi>Joſhua</hi> put the enemies of Gods people under their feet, ſo Chriſt ſhall then put all our enemies under our feet; Shall we now ſee cauſe of rejoycing, becauſe God hath weakned the ſtrength, &amp; enfeebled the forces of our enemies? and ſhall there not be greater cauſe of rejoycing at the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Saints ſhall ſee all powers againſt them brought to nothing? Hell, ſin, the world, men and Devills being trampled under their feet. Chriſt is filled with prayſes and joy, becauſe his Father <hi>hath given him the necks of his enemies, that he may deſtroy them that hate him, Pſal.</hi> 18.40. So the Saints ſhall be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in glory, becauſe, <hi>they ſhall execute venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the Heathen, and puniſhment upon the people. Binding their Kings with chaines, and their Nobles with fetters of iron, Pſal.</hi> 140.7.8. For the Saints ſhall ſit together upon the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:180666:261"/>bench with the Lord Jeſus to judge then that unjuſtly judged them upon earth. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ungodly men, that for the profeſſion of truth, have brought Saints before judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeats; and have jeer'd, and ſcoffed at them, making them their paſtime and merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall be brought before the Saints, and the Saints ſhall ſit upon the Judgement ſeate with the Lord, and paſſe a ſentence of condemnation upon them. When the Lord delivered the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and avenged himſelfe upon their enemies in the time of <hi>Barak</hi> and <hi>Deborah, Judg.</hi> 5.1, 2. they ſung a ſong o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> prayſes unto the Lord, So the Saints ſhall rejoyce, becauſe God at the reſurrection ſhall avenge himſelfe upon the implacable enemies of his glory. Therefore when the Judgement is paſſed upon <hi>Babylon;</hi> the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are commanded to rejoyce; <hi>Rejoyce over thou Heaven, Rev.</hi> 18.20. That is, ye Saints who are Inhabitants and Citizens of Heaven, for God hath avenged you on her; ſo that we ſhall have the ſame cauſes of joy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing at the generall reſurrection, which we have here, this joy which wee have here, in theſe things, being but as it were the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and figure of the joy which wee ſhall have hereafter.</p>
               <p>Then in the next place; another thing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:180666:261"/>that will heighten the joy of the Saints at the reſurrection, will be the eternitie of their joy. Eternity, is the hell of hell; there is no torment that makes hell to be ſuch a place of torment as it is, as the eternity of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell: ſo the eternitie of the joyes of Heaven, is the very Heaven of Heaven, and this eternity of joy is the eternall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints. The joy that the Saints ſhall have, is not for a moment; as our joyes are here, vaniſhing, and tranſitory; Joy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to us in the morning, and ſorrow comes in the evening, that wee have more cauſe to weep, and mourne before night, then wee had to rejoyce in the day. It ſhall not be ſo then, there ſhall be joy that ſhall be lengthned out to eternity; joy that ſhall have no period, nor end: when wee have rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced many hundred thouſands of yeares; wee ſhall rejoyce then, and our joyes ſhall be ſo new and pleaſing unto us, as though wee had never rejoyced before: we ſhall never be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our joy.</p>
               <p>We find we are weary of joy and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here, and therefore there muſt be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of joy, and recreations by the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of divers things, or elſe they will not give us content: but here ſhall alway be the ſame joy, the ſame cauſe of joy, and the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:180666:262"/>ſame joy alway new; The ſong which wee ſhall ſing ſhall alwayes be a new ſong. The Kingdome that is promiſed, is a <hi>Kingdome that cannot be moved, Heb.</hi> 12.28. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe that ſhall be in it ſhall be <hi>an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting righteouſneſſe,</hi> the ſalvation of it ſhall be <hi>an everlaſting ſalvation, Iſa.</hi> 45.17. The joy of it ſhall be everlaſting joy, <hi>Everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their head, Iſa.</hi> 51.11. The Crownes that we ſhall weare ſhall be <hi>Crownes of glory, that ſhall never fade away,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Wee ſhall be ever with the Lord;</hi> we ſhall alwaies enjoy the viſion of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſo ſhall alwayes have cauſe of joy, and rejoycing in him.</p>
               <p>The tranſitory, and momentanie conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of earthly joyes, pleaſures and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is that, that imbitters all the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe earthly joyes, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo that, that ſhall ſweeten the joy of the Saints at the reſurrection, will be the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of their joy, it ſhall be joy that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have an end: ſo the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>at thy right hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> They are laſting joyes, everlaſting joyes, they ſhall be like God himſelfe, they ſhall have no end: but the Saints that are raiſed in joy, ſhall be happy in that joy for evermore.</p>
               <p>But why doe I ſpend ſo much time to ſet
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:180666:262"/>forth theſe joyes? Truly I cannot give you a full relation of them. <hi>Sheba's</hi> Queen, when ſhe had ſeene the glorie of <hi>Solomons</hi> Palace, his ſervants and attendance about him, and the glory, and pompe of his earthly Eſtate, ſhe confeſſed that the fame in her owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, was nothing to that ſhe had ſeene with her eyes, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.7. <hi>I beleeved not the words untill I came, and mine eyes had ſeene it, and behold the halfe was not told me: thy wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and proſperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.</hi> Fame commonly exceeds the thing which is reported; but <hi>Solomons</hi> glory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the fame of it. So, we heare of great and glorious things which ſhall be at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; the joy and glorie that the Saints ſhall have, and we take paines to illuſtrate it by earthly joyes and ſpirituall comfort, which is the beſt thing to ſhadow it. But all that can be ſaid is far ſhort of ſetting forth to the full, the glorie, and joy of it. And therefore ſeeing that the thing farre exceeds the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and apprehenſion of any man; ſeeing words cannot ſet forth, what glorie, and joy this is: I will not lay downe any more conſiderations to ſhadow forth to you this joy, which I profeſſe I want language fully to expreſſe. Wherefore give me leave to make a little uſe, and I ſhall put a period for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:180666:263"/>of ſpeaking of this joy which is unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, ſeeing there will be great joy at the reſurrection, therefore wee ſhould rejoice in it before-hand: God will not faile in giving you of any thing that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: you will find the joy a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times greater then any man on earth is able to expreſſe it to you.</p>
               <p>As God, when he promiſed the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that flowed with milk and honey, he did not faile of any thing he had promiſed to them, all came to paſſe, as you have the ſtorie, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.45. So God hath promiſed a heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> of glorie, an everlaſting Kingdome; <hi>a City which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God Heb.</hi> 11.10. Palaces that ſhall ſtand faſt, and firme upon their baſis and foundation to the dayes of Eternitie. He hath promiſed to put Scepters into our hands, Crowns of glory upon our heads.

So, let us who are the Heires of Heaven, happineſſe and glorie here, though wee ſhall not have the fruition of it untill hereafter, rejoyce here as though wee were in the full enjoyment, and poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>Suffer not any wicked, unbelieving ſpirits, to bereave you of your joy and comfort, by leading you into errour, concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. O what enemies are theſe people to the ſpirituall joy of Gods people, that goe about to ſow this ſeed of falſe Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, by perſwading them that there ſhall be no reſurrection of the bodie, but onely a ſpirituall reſurrection here? How doe theſe with ſpecious ſhewes of truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave people of that ſpirituall joy, comfort, and contentment that they might take in believing the Doctrine of the reſurrection?</p>
               <p>Beloved, you meet with many Arguments againſt the reſurrection that baffle carnall reaſon: I profeſſe that if I ſhould follow car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſon, I know there are ſuch ſtrong Arguments againſt the reſurrection, that I ſhould eaſily yeild the bucklers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no more for the point; but conclude
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:180666:264"/>that there would be no reſurrection of the bodie: but when I looke upon the power of him that hath promiſed; when I conſider that God hath ſaid it; it anſwers all objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of carnall reaſon. Therefore ſhew your ſelves children of faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſtagger not at this promiſe, he believed above hope and againſt hope. It is above hope, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the hope of naturall reaſon that this bodie ſhould be raiſed: yet give God the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his power, God hath ſaid that this bodie ſhall riſe, and riſe as the body of his Sonne; that <hi>we ſhall awake and ſing, and the Earth ſhall caſt forth her dead.</hi> (<hi>Conſider a au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorem &amp; tolle dubitationem</hi> Ter.) Conſider the power of the agent, and all doubting will be removed. He that hath promiſed it, is power, love, and faithfulneſſe: he will doe what he hath promiſed for his people, what they expect, and beyond their thoughts deſires, and expectations; therefore 1 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 4. <hi>ult. Comfort your ſelves with theſe words.</hi> There is no Doctrine that brings ſo much ſpirituall conſolation to the ſoule as this: it is the ſpring of ſpirituall joy in the hearts of the Saints. Take away the Doctrine of the reſurrection of bodies, and take away all ſpirituall joy, and comfort. And then look no longer upon the Saints as glorious, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:180666:264"/>happie creatures but as the moſt miſerable abjects that you behold upon the face of the earth. If there be no reſurrection of the dead, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We are of al men moſt miſerable.</hi> Saints profeſſe themſelvs the moſt happie and joyfull people in the world, and rejoyce in their portion, and bleſſe themſelves in their happineſſe, and inheritance. But take this Doctrine away, let it be granted that there ſhall be no reſurrection, let it bee granted that Chriſt is not riſen in his humane bodie, and that the Saints ſhall not riſe in their humane bodies as Chriſt did, and be happie in their humane bodies: it will damp all the joy of the Saints preſently, it will quench the Spirit of joy in the people of God. For there can be no cauſe of rejoycing to the Saints but in this aſſurance, that their ſinnes are pardoned, that they are in Covenant with God, that God having loved them from eternitie, will love them to eternitie, and preſerve them in happineſſe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Therefore you that truly believe this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine rejoyce in it, and ſuffer not the ſcoffing enemies of this Doctrine to draw you from it, and ſo from the comfort that will flow into your hearts while you believe it. <hi>Take heed leſt there be in any of you a heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,

               <p>And let me adde this alſo, that as this is a Doctrine of great joy; ſo it is a Doctrine that obligeth us to great holineſſe.

Who would bee envious at wicked men, that grow rich, and proſper, and flouriſh in the world; that get great eſtates, and leave their eſtates and houſes to their heires, if they did but conſider, that at the reſurrection they ſhall be enforced to take hell as part of their purchaſe, and ſhall be drawne and dragged as ſlaves to eternall torments?</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:180666:268"/>and ſing, and be happie in a more full enjoyment of God; and this is the deſire of thoſe that are truly faithfull. When Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He will come, and appeare;</hi> What doe the Saints anſwer? <hi>Even ſo come Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> Rev. 22.2.</p>
               <p>If a naturall, carnall man, ſhould ſpeake forth that which lies at the bottome of his heart, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He will come;</hi> he would ſay; O Lord never come, I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to thine Image; I am not made a new creature by hearing of thy Goſpel; O let me never ſee the face of Chriſt. But the man that knows the love of God, and truly underſtands the everlaſting Goſpel, when he heares Chriſt ſay, <hi>I come;</hi> preſently there is this eccho, by which he anſwereth the Lord Chriſt in his owne Spirit; <hi>Even ſo come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>

                  <hi>Beloved, Thinke it not ſtrange concerning the fiery triall, which is to try you, as though ſome ſtrange thing happened unto you. But rejoyce in as much as yee are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings, that when his glory ſhall be revealed, yee may be glad alſo with exceeding joy,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.13, 14. God leads his people to happineſſe by ſtraits. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is a Palace of glory, a ſpacious place; but the way to it is narrow, the gate is ſtraite, by which wee muſt enter in unto it. Let the joyes provided for us at the end of our journey, ſweeten unto us the troubles and difficulties of the way. God intended to make <hi>Job</hi> a great man, but before God brings him to his full height of greatneſſe, God firſt brings him to the dunghill. So God will bring us firſt to the dunghill, he will lay us in the duſt, and then make us ſuch glorious creatures, as you have heard the Saints ſhall be at the reſurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph</hi> was to be ruler in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but firſt he muſt be laid in priſon: ſo God layes his firſt in priſon, he brings them to a low condition, to be nothing in the world; and afterward layes them in the priſon of the grave, and then hee raiſeth them to be Kings, Prieſts, Rulers, and Judges with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore let this meditation of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſweeten trouble, and perſume the grave unto us.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:180666:269"/>
               <p>And let it likewiſe ſweeten all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that wee enjoy here, by looking upon them as pledges of the joy which wee ſhall have at the reſurrection: Let it ſweeten the mercies of this day, which will have little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in them without this. Alas; what is it to looke on Nationall deliverances, mercies, victories, and conqueſts over our enemies; unleſſe you ſee your happineſſe in the Lord Jeſus? What is it if the Land have peace, if thou haſt not peace of conſcience by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving? What is it, if the enemies of thy body, of the State and Kingdome be wholly routed, and put under the feete of thoſe that deſire to ſtand for the liberties of the Subject; if in the meane while thou be a vaſſall, and a ſlave to the Prince of darkneſſe? What is it for thee to be free from corporall enemies, and yet to be under the power, and led captive by the enemy of thy ſoule? What is it, if thou be a freeman in thy body, and a ſlave in thy ſoule, to all luſts, filthineſſe, and ungodlineſſe? What is it, to keepe ſuch a day as this, and to rejoyce in a carnall way for outward mercies, when thou doeſt not ſpiritually rejoyce in the firſt place, that God hath freed thee from the enemies of thy eternall ſalvation? Rejoyce not onely as a Heathen may for nationall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, but rejoyce as a Chriſtian, ſeeing God
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:180666:270"/>reconciled to thee in the Sonne of his love; let the joy of the reſurrection both ſweeten thy troubles, and adde ſpirituall fewell to the flame of thy joy for temporall mercies.</p>
               <p>Truly, wee then rejoyce in temporall things, and in creature-comforts and mercies aright, when we rejoyce in them in a ſpirituall way, when wee ſee all ſweetened to us in the Lord Jeſus. Therefore improve to the full this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for the heightening of your joyes this day. Let there not be an evill heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe in any, to keepe him from rejoycing. Though there were great plentie of Corne in <hi>Samaria,</hi> yet the Lord that would not beleeve what the Prophet ſaid, though he ſaw it, he did not taſte of it, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.19. I tell you of great plentie, and happineſſe, I have ſet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, as God hath enabled me; but unleſſe you beleeve, you ſhall never taſte of this heavenly Manna; you ſhall never drinke of theſe rivers of pleaſure. Here is a cup of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you that have the lips of faith drinke, and your ſoules ſhall be refreſhed and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the enjoyment of it: but if you lie in unbeliefe, you may want the joy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that you might have of it here, and you may want the enjoyment of it to all eternitie. Therefore beleeve what hath been ſpoken, what God hath promiſed, and rejoyce in it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:180666:270"/>here, being confident that thou ſhalt enjoy what God hath promiſed. And what thou haſt <hi>(in ſpe,)</hi> in hope here, thou ſhalt hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have <hi>(in re,)</hi> in full fruition; ſerving God chearfully, joyfully, and comfortably in the aſſurance of happineſſe by Jeſus Chriſt at the reſurrection: thou ſhalt be happie with God, and with Jeſus Chriſt at the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in body, and ſpirit. Which God of his infinite mercy grant unto us all, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>He doth parallel them with ſome ancient Heretiques; and farther enlarging himſelfe concerning them, doth give us this account of their proceedings.

Of their ſubtlety which they make uſe of to deceive the ſimple, he afterwards thus ſpeaketh.</p>
                  <p>They doe not declare to men what is their judgement, but hold them in ſuſpence a long while, and lead them about, by ambages, whom they doe deſire to bring to their ſect, not revealing their ſecrets unto them, before they are ſo deluded and bewitched by them,
